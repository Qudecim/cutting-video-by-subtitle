"Seek the truth

"Seek the truth

1
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:30,485
"Seek the truth
not in the mundane details of daily life,

but in the essence of life itself."

B. Tosia

4
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,448
"Members of the jury..."

5
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,347
"... for three days..."
"... you have listened carefully to..."

"You are aware of the..."

00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,507
"Members of the jury..."

00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,027
"... stand the gravity..."

12
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,548
"... to the testimony..."

13
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,177
"If you agree with the prosecution..."

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,982
"... you must return a"
"verdict of "guilty"..."

15
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,433
"... or not..."

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,118
"For 1000 years..."

17
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,696
"... the Russian people gave"
"so much so that..."

18
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,942
"... on these broad expanses"
"different nations were..."

19
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,583
"... united under the banner"
"of this federation..."

00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,831

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,103

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,713
"... must return a verdict..."

00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,831
"... now deliberate in private..."

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,852
"... not limited by time..."

25
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,787
"You are aware of the"
"prosecution's request..."

26
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,071

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,046

29
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,527
"... penalty allowed by law..."

30
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,506
"... that your decision must be unanimous..."

31
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,193
"... unanimous"

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,831
"I do not have words to describe"
"my state of mind..."

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,353
"... in these moments..."

34
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,306

00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,162

38
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,280
"... you must return"
"a verdict of "not guilty"..."

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,920
"I remind you that"
"your decision must be..."

40
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,986
"... you must return a verdict of "guilty"

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,759
"... maximum penalty..."

00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,439

"... I repeat: The jury may request..."

45
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,501
"If you find reasonable doubt..."

46
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,711
PEACE, LABOR, HAPPINESS!.

47
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,706
GLORY TO
THE PEOPLE'S RADIANT FUTURE

48
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,872
Mama!

49
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,236
Speak Russian!

50
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,766
Speak Russian, Mama!

51
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,106
Speak Russian, Mama!

52
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,287
Speak Russian, Mama!

53
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,100
Court is adjourned until
the jury reaches a verdict.

54
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,086
All rise please.

55
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,223
Hello?

56
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,467
Hungry, dad?

57
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,972
So far everything's fine. Yes.

58
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,975
Those photographs
I showed the judge, can I take them?

59
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,432
I don't know.

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,852
- Do I have to stay here?
- Yes.

61
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,362
- But I told them everything.
- That's how it works.

62
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,487
- OK, gentlemen...
- That's crazy.

63
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,855
Please follow me.
Hurry, please, it's almost recess.

64
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,372
- What recess?
- You'll see.

65
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,687
Please keep up. Follow me.

66
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,232
This way, please. Let's go.

67
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,815
As you see, the work's not finished.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,072
The jury room's not ready, either.
This way...

69
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,510
Remodeling makes it hard to work.
No matter, your case is simple.

70
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,807
You'll be done in 20 minutes.

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,630
Now we're in the adjoining school building,
they lend us space.

72
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,240
A school by a courthouse
causes problems.

73
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,731
Imagine the spring, the windows open...

74
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,832
...a ball flies in and hits a witness
on the head

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,002
An elderly woman, out cold.

76
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,020
During the school vacation
it was fine...

77
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,430
...we used the classrooms...
Oops, we're too late.

78
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,079
Children! Children!

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,233
Oh, Lord. Children.

80
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,101
Children!
Children, please.

81
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,992
Now we turn left.
This way, everyone this way.

82
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,965
Some working conditions!
But it's just temporary.

83
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,216
They'll finish and it'll be
pretty as a picture.

84
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,781
One silly formality.

85
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,235
You'll have to give me your phones,
I'm afraid.

86
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,731
I'll keep my SIM, it's important.

87
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,478
Hello, Vasia.

88
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,568
My phone'll be off for 90 minutes.

89
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,056
Tell the boss it's my civic duty.

90
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,632
I'll be right here.

91
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,072
If you need me for any reason...

92
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,232
...there's a communication system.
Here it is.

93
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,096
This is my little "know-how".

94
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,487
That means "invention".

95
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,640
I took it from my son's
model train set.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,718
It really works.

97
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,808
Watch, everyone.
Push the button.

98
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,792
That's awful.

99
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,911
You keep this.

100
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,237
And if you need me,
for the slightest reason, call me...

101
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,824
and I'll bring
whatever you require or desire.

102
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,076
Here's where you'll be meeting.
All the amenities. Go ahead.

103
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,194
Go ahead.

104
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,438
Hands...

105
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,255
- They put us in a gym?
- The jury room's not ready.

106
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,786
Anyone know how long it takes
to get to Kursk station?

107
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,422
In weather like this.

108
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,326
At least an hour and a half.
Maybe a little longer.

109
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,913
You're kidding.

110
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,648
Come on, take a shot.

111
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,217
- With this thing?
- Come on.

112
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,766
- Go Spartak.
- Here it comes!

113
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,242
- What was that?
- You told me to.

114
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,102
That's a medicine ball.

115
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,923
That's an antique.

116
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,202
- You mean the lamp?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,141
We had exactly the same kind
in my school.

118
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,708
- Kids use these?
- Sure.

119
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,126
Do you know where the bathroom is?

120
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,438
They're locking us in?

121
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,781
They have to, those are the rules.

122
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,792
Seen that?

123
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,328
Why is it in there?

124
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,396
- Maybe so the kids don't hurt it.
- Or vice versa.

125
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,846
Or vice versa, so they
don't hurt themselves on it.

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,797
It could fall.

127
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,227
A courthouse isn't...

128
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,307
the best thing to have
next to a school.

129
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,582
It won't fall.

130
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,996
Even the piano's behind bars
and on the rack.

131
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,638
The bathroom.

132
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,192
Smart, no?

133
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,423
Why don't you have some?
Help yourself, it's for all of us.

134
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,505
- What is it, cheese?
- And tea with lemon.

135
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,772
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

136
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,232
I have a business lunch
at Cafe Pushkin.

137
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,983
Don't want to spoil my appetite.

138
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,946
And this won't take very long, right?

139
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,827
I doubt it. It's not that kind of case.

140
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,482
I agree.

141
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,237
We have

142
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,056
a different kind of case.

143
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,506
That's an antique. How quaint.

144
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,442
I had it stashed away.

145
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,051
I forgot and didn't
exchange it in time.

146
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,003
I was so angry...

147
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,848
Comrades... I mean...

148
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,807
...gentlemen. Let's start.

149
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,045
Yes, comrades, I mean, gentlemen,
why don't we start?

150
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,612
I don't have much time.

151
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,972
You in a hurry?

152
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,799
And how: My train's in an hour.
I'm going on tour.

153
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,747
This'll take an hour, max.
The bathroom...

154
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,740
This one's for the kids.
VIPs go over there.

155
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,283
Can anyone tell me...

156
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,226
...what rhymes with "Julie"?

157
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,770
- Julie - cruelly.
- Cruelly? That's no good.

158
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,556
- It's a beautiful girl named Julie.
- Julie?

159
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,028
Here you go...

160
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,636
Duly.
Newly. Unruly.

161
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,820
O'Dooley. Fazooli. Babooli.
Coolly...

162
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,848
Woolly.

163
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,852
Truly.

164
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,521
- Patchouli.
- Patchouli?

165
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,768
Patchouli. Truly.

166
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,212
Mamooli. Pap...

167
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,398
Oh, God...

168
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,719
- Is today the 12th?
- Yeah.

169
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,625
- Where's the TV? Over here?
- Right there.

170
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,486
They're interviewing my mother.

171
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,032
Is she a politician? An actress?

172
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,293
- It doesn't work?
- No.

173
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,991
What is this? That's it.

174
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,596
It doesn't work.

175
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,724
Our family has a TV company.
LTV. Have you heard of it?

176
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,247
My mother's the president.

177
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,876
I'm the managing director.
I help Mom.

178
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,937
So you're an assistant producer.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,213
Must be a weak stomach...

180
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,172
- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- Sorry.

181
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,242
Ever seen one like this?

182
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,285
And she's still just a schoolgirl.
They must be well fed.

183
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,080
I only saw ones this big
once in my life.

184
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,472
- On a schoolgirl?
- What? Heavens, no.

185
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,491
My mother-in-law's were about this size.

186
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,021
We buried her three months ago.

187
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,713
Oh, jeez!

188
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,432
"Schoolmates!"

189
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,532
"Boys and girls!"

190
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,199
- Look what I found.
- Oh, wow.

191
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,512
"We sing the same songs"

192
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,376
"We read the same books"

193
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,561
- Let me see. God.
- Advanced classes!

194
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,152
Forgive me.

195
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,908
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,599
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,185
I lost my brother because
of that junk.

198
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,817
He was 36!

199
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,066
Oh, mama!
How much misfortune...

200
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,642
I have seen from this junk.

201
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,871
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,770
Gentlemen of the jury...
Let's get this show on the road.

203
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,042
Who's leading this parade?

204
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,573
- Yes, let's start.
- Let's go.

205
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,671
Actually, we do have to...

206
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,546
...choose a chairman for our meeting,
I mean for our jury.

207
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,449
You seem to have some experience.
You should be our foreman...

208
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,786
The phone only connects
to the boiler room.

209
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,088
If nobody objects...

210
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,042
I'd be glad to.

211
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,902
So, no need to vote on it, then?

212
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,200
As you know, our decision
must be, and will be, final.

213
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,067
And not subject to appeal.

214
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,400
And so... Attention, please.
And so...

215
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,585
...our vote has got to be unanimous.

216
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,667
We know all that.
Let's just do it fast.

217
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,571
Make a unanimous decision...
and leave. I'm going on tour.

218
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,430
We can each make comments one by one.
Then we'll vote.

219
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,732
- No, let's vote.
- It's obvious.

220
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,092
- Let's vote now.
- No comments.

221
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,895
- Then nobody objects if...
- No, no.

222
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,048
So, we can...

223
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,930
...vote by the usual show of hands,
or by paper ballot.

224
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,641
- No, by hands.
- Right.

225
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,360
- Let's vote.
- So we'll vote by a show of hands?

226
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,316
- Yes, yes.
- Of course.

227
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,545
All in favor, please raise your hands.

228
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,545
One question.
"In favor" of what?

229
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,951
- What?
- "In favor" of guilty, or not guilty?

230
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,008
Guilty, of course.

231
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,112
I thought it was "in favor" of voting.

232
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,555
We're voting on whether he is guilty.

233
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,632
I didn't understand, that's all.

234
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,927
- He didn't know
- Put down your hands. Sorry.

235
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,435
That vote didn't count.
My fault. Sorry.

236
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,726
So... Put your hands down.

237
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,912
So we're voting...

238
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,130
...on whether the defendant is guilty.

239
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,377
A raised hand means guilty.

240
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,628
- Yes, yes.
- Guilty.

241
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,208
I just want to get it right.
Then raise your hand.

242
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,927
Don't you go to meetings?

243
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,047
What? All the time.

244
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,677
Workers of the world...

245
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,598
- Let's vote, come on.
- Yeah.

246
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,791
Why are we voting on "guilty" first?

247
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,576
What's the difference?

248
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,959
No, we can do this however we like.

249
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,121
Does it bother you?

250
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,027
No, I thought it might be a rule.

251
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,806
No, there's no rule about that.
Either way.

252
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,600
- Let's do it this way.
- For whether he's guilty.

253
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:11,628
OK. So we're voting on
whether the defendant is guilty.

254
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,317
- Yes.
- Hands up, please.

255
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,386
- Unanimous. We're out of here.
- No, wait.

256
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,881
Please. There are rules. Wait

257
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,830
Please take your seats.
Put your hands down.

258
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,667
Now, who thinks the defendant -
we have to follow rules...

259
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,809
...is not guilty, please raise your hand.

260
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,048
That's eleven...

261
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,947
- Here
- Eleven for guilty, one for not guilty.

262
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,802
Whoa!

263
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,367
What did we just vote on?

264
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,461
Did you hear that? Hello!

265
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,052
All that racket distracted the man.

266
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,825
We voted on whether that stinking
Chechen dog is guilty...

267
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,010
...of the murder of his adoptive father,
a Russian army officer.

268
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,513
Didn't understand?

269
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,792
The comrade didn't understand.
Start again.

270
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,215
- So let's vote again.
- No, no, I...

271
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,545
There's no need. I get it now.
I'm against.

272
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,212
Against convicting him.

273
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,997
What do you mean "against"?

274
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,852
You voted "for".

275
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,726
And I voted "against".

276
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,383
Why?

277
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,121
Well, it was eleven "for"...

278
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,128
...and one "against".

279
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,603
But why?

280
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,552
Why what?

281
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,856
Why did you vote that way?

282
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,969
Well, if I'd voted "for"
it would have been twelve "for" and...

283
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,946
...none "against".
And we'd all have gone home.

284
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,195
But that'd be good.
So why'd you vote "against"?

285
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,771
Vote "for" and let's go home.

286
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,912
I... It was too fast, somehow.

287
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,427
It was too fast, you see.

288
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,600
Fast? We listened to that judge talk
for 3 days. You call that fast?

289
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,302
No, well, yes, but...

290
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,686
It scared me.
We just put up our hands and...

291
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,932
...that was it. It was too fast.

292
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,555
Fast is good. It was obvious,
there was proof.

293
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,156
We all heard the witnesses.
We saw the evidence.

294
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,798
Well, yes.

295
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,300
But we're talking about a human being.

296
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,262
And we just put up our hands...

297
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,237
...and that was it.

298
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,345
What exactly do you want?

299
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,758
I want...

300
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,257
...well, to talk, at least.

301
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,032
To talk.

302
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,712
So talk.

303
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,860
"Beyond reasonable doubt. "

304
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,004
Sorry. That's a term
used in American jury trials.

305
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,522
"Beyond reasonable doubt".

306
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,161
It's just that, I studied at Harvard...

307
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,744
...I studied management.
And we had a course in law.

308
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:26,813
Talking would make sense
if there were reasonable doubt.

309
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,710
Did you hear that? Reasonable doubt.
We don't have any doubts

310
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,417
None. He killed him! It's a fact!

311
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,559
The brutal murder of an ex-officer
by his adopted son for a ridiculous sum.

312
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,437
- Yeah.
- Why talk?

313
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,420
That guy went to Harvard,
and he doesn't have any doubts.

314
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,011
- Neither do we. Do you?
- Do you?

315
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,096
Forgive me, please, and understand.

316
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,531
I know he went to Harvard.

317
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,996
Say you go to the market
and buy a watermelon.

318
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,142
- I do?
- No, no, I do.

319
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,136
I go to the market and buy a melon.

320
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,234
The salesman assures me
it's ripe and red, but...

321
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,652
...until I take it home...

322
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,580
...and cut it open,
it's very hard to know for sure if it is.

323
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,581
But this isn't a watermelon.

324
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,420
A watermelon you can just throw away.

325
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,737
This is a human being
facing a life sentence.

326
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,606
If we all vote yes,
they'll put him in prison forever.

327
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,092
And he'll never get out.

328
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,411
Do you understand? Ne-ver!

329
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,011
Just think about that word.

330
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,671
He'll never get out.

331
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,517
And he shouldn't.

332
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,871
He's a killer. What should he get?

333
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,242
A paid vacation to Thailand?

334
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,095
He should be grateful
they banned the death penalty.

335
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,982
Prison will put some sense into him.

336
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,472
All right.

337
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,303
All right.

338
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,827
Fine.

339
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,782
I don't want to keep you.

340
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,135
Let's vote again
and if I'm still the only one, I'll...

341
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,402
...vote with everyone else.

342
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,306
And let the boy's fate be what it will.

343
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,496
At least I'll know I tried
to do something for him.

344
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,127
That's an interesting move.

345
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,125
Essentially, you'll do
what everyone else does,

346
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,725
but you'll still be able to believe that
your hands are clean. Right?

347
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,073
Yes.

348
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,843
It looks that way.

349
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,212
But I request a secret ballot.

350
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,668
Why?

351
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,576
Honestly? To stall for time.

352
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:41,375
We have to get paper, pens.
That takes time.

353
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,622
Also, people often vote...

354
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,666
...just so they don't
stray from the group.

355
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,730
So I request that we vote
by secret ballot.

356
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,060
Secret or not, it's obvious
what the result will be.

357
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,499
So, we have a proposal for
a secret ballot

358
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,622
- Does everyone agree?
- Yeah.

359
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,339
- With these?
- Yes, take a ballot and a pencil or pen.

360
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,416
If we're ready to vote,
let's see if we're all here.

361
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,117
Wait...

362
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,533
Someone's missing.

363
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,859
That gentleman went to the bathroom.
I saw him.

364
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,630
- I saw him, honest.
- Why wait? Let's vote.

365
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,336
- He's an elderly man.
- Let's start.

366
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:59,670
He has to get there and pee,
maybe a bad prostate...

367
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,336
Then put all his equipment back in...

368
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,642
The ballot box. Let's vote.

369
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,655
I see you've done this before.

370
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,751
Yeah. Retirement's boring.

371
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,644
I sit at my dacha and paint watercolors.
Sometimes I serve on juries.

372
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,365
- You're an artist?
- No, not really.

373
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,501
I just paint watercolors as a hobby.

374
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,952
Has everyone turned in their ballot?

375
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,020
- Did you vote already?
- No, we were waiting for you.

376
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,516
"With birth and urination,
there's no procrastination".

377
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,882
Don't worry, I'll be fast.

378
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,048
What a great one-liner!

379
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,208
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

380
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,513
Well...

381
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,478
Let's count...
... shall we?

382
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,752
"Guilty".

383
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,112
"Guilty".

384
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,987
"Guilty".

385
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,553
"Guilty".

386
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,432
"Guilty".

387
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,119
"Guilty".

388
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,868
"Guilty".

389
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,227
"Guilty".

390
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,157
"Guilty".

391
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,598
"Not guilty".

392
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,502
"Guilty".

393
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,302
So, that's ten...

394
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,666
...for "guilty," and one against.

395
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,147
Two.

396
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,107
Two.

397
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,726
Two. For "not guilty".

398
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,273
What? Two?

399
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,323
Wait. That can't be.

400
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,976
Let me check those ballots.

401
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,843
There's no need.

402
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,486
No need to check anything.

403
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,525
I voted to find the young man
not guilty.

404
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,593
What?

405
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,585
5 minutes ago you voted
that the kid is guilty.

406
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,886
At first it seemed clear.

407
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:29,690
- And now it doesn't?
- No, I can't say it's not clear.

408
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,251
But this man...

409
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,450
...proposed that I take responsibility
for his decision, as well.

410
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,952
And you know, I began to think.

411
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,757
About what?

412
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,610
Excuse me, but I don't understand.
This is some sort of Jewish logic.

413
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,477
Absolutely correct.

414
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,752
I'm a Jew. 100 per cent Jewish.

415
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,542
And like everyone,
I have tons of faults.

416
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,486
But I do have one virtue.
And it's an innately Jewish one.

417
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,767
Thoughtfulness. I treasure it.

418
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,896
I became thoughtful and went off
to think...

419
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,946
And you know,
I began to have doubts.

420
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,023
Why?

421
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,542
The lawyer.

422
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,551
- The lawyer what?
- He was bored.

423
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,325
Why be excited?
That Chechen monster killed his father.

424
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,711
I had the impression
he wasn't even defending him.

425
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,631
And he was right!
There's no reason to defend him.

426
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:31,235
Exactly. There was no reason.

427
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,206
The boy is destitute,
the lawyer's eyes were empty:

428
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,351
The face of a drunk,
he couldn't function.

429
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,056
Is it because he's not Jewish?

430
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,778
Drunk? Maybe, but honest.

431
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,747
Didn't let a killer off the hook.
But you had a hunch.

432
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,558
You should pray after a hunch.

433
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,761
10 adults had no hunch at all.

434
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,463
- But you did.
- In the can.

435
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,222
Exactly, a sudden hunch in the can.

436
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,203
I think better in there.

437
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,416
Everyone does.
Why are you so worried?

438
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,019
There are 10 of you and only 2 of us.
We should be worried.

439
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,838
But I am worried.

440
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,156
I am worried, see.
How can I not be?

441
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,557
Because I see how you and your
Jewish tricks...

442
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,701
...are muddying an obvious case.

443
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,771
You didn't like the lawyer,
so you just changed your mind.

444
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,912
That's a typical Jewish move.

445
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,958
That's enough.

446
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,466
I didn't change my mind.
And I'm half Jewish.

447
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,853
No such thing as a half-Jew.

448
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,323
Is that a good thing...

449
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,112
...or a bad thing?

450
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,436
Now you, my friend...

451
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,843
...stay out of this

452
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,419
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

453
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,631
Look how much Umar likes your present.

454
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,431
Umar, come eat.
Uncle Volodya is here.

455
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,952
OK, then.

456
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,533
Listen, so you found...

457
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,554
...a good, kind, naive person,
and dragged him over to your side.

458
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,317
- "Braids"
- What?

459
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,330
- What rhymes with it?
- Just a minute. "Braids". "Grenades"!

460
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,981
No, I'm absolutely sure
that we'll all reach the same conclusion.

461
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,276
You'll waste time,
tell us another parable...

462
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,820
...about choosing watermelons
or about how to buy fresh fish.

463
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,273
I don't see why.

464
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,695
You'll make us go over everything
we heard in court for three days.

465
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,912
All the evidence
of that scumbag's guilt...

466
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,834
...that you'll never disprove,
because you can't. And then?

467
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,250
Then that man'll go
to the can again.

468
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,062
To think. He'll change his decision
to the correct one.

469
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,265
Believe me
that's exactly what'll happen.

470
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,832
What I don't get is,
why stall for time?

471
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,083
To go over the witness statements again?
You're not blind and deaf.

472
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,193
You saw that monster sitting in court.

473
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,261
You want to talk?
So let's talk.

474
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,102
Let's talk about how you think
you can defend a pig...

475
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,101
...who can't possibly be justified.

476
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,480
How can you justify a monster
who attacks his adoptive father?

477
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,417
And not just attacked...

478
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:38,216
...but cut his father's throat like a sheep.

479
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,166
He killed the man who took care of him...
... who raised him.

480
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,006
He butchered a man
who had done nothing to him.

481
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,151
Not only that,
but the man who adopted him.

482
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,306
Who saved him.
And it doesn't matter why.

483
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,349
For his pension or because
he yelled at him. I don't care about that.

484
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,089
I can't get my head around it.
I couldn't think of a single word to say...

485
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,020
...in defense of that bastard.

486
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,441
I don't think any of us could.

487
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,027
I don't think you could.

488
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,776
So then what's the point of
this sideshow?

489
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,788
Sorry.

490
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,156
- I had a wife.
- Wives? I've had three wives.

491
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,107
Wait. I had a wife. I loved her.

492
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,705
- He couldn't keep her... Like the rhyme.
- Just wait. I really loved her.

493
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,832
We had a tiny room
with hardly any furniture.

494
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,050
We even ate dinner on the floor,
because we had no table.

495
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,709
I was a junior researcher
in a physics institute.

496
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,462
I was developing one of my ideas.

497
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,506
So my wife had to work three jobs...

498
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,977
...so we could make ends meet.

499
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:03,619
Long story short, I invented a new
tunnel diode. It's...

500
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,887
It's hard to explain.

501
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,049
At work they congratulated me...

502
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,941
...gave me a 50-ruble bonus
and proposed I work on a new project

503
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,041
So I went home...

504
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,619
...with the result of three years" work:
Fifty rubles.

505
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,616
My wife gave me a look...

506
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,968
...like you'd give...

507
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,377
Then a large foreign company...

508
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,875
...offered to buy my patent
for a lot of money.

509
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,867
But I said no, I wanted it
to be used here.

510
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,212
I offered it to various places.

511
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,496
They said "It's great".
But nobody needed it. Nobody.

512
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,711
I began to drink.
I began to drink terribly.

513
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,053
I lost my job, my wife left me.

514
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:54,515
I only cared about drinking.
Morning, noon, and night.

515
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,490
I was dead drunk from morning to night.
It was awful.

516
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:04,191
One day I sensed I would die soon.

517
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,190
And the thought even made me happy,
It didn't scare me at all.

518
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,456
All I wanted was for it to be soon.

519
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,325
I began to look for death, I really did,
I looked for it.

520
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,235
I would fight with police, bother people
I got beaten up and cut.

521
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,441
I slept on the street,
in and out of hospitals.

522
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,442
I was beaten to a pulp.

523
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,756
But I'd pull through and
crawl back out.

524
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,526
At home I'd lick my wounds
like a stray dog and then...

525
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,317
...crawl out again.

526
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,237
My only fear was...

527
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,921
...jumping under a train
or out of a window.

528
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,252
Don't know why, it just scared me.

529
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:48,671
One day I was on a train,
dreadfully drunk.

530
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,478
I was filthy, I stank.

531
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:54,410
The train was full
I was bothering everyone:

532
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,686
Yelling, cursing.

533
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,000
But I looked at myself and I was glad.
My vileness made me glad!

534
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,450
My only wish was
that someone would take me...

535
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,195
...and toss me off the train
so I'd bash my brains on the rails.

536
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,940
But they all just sat silently.

537
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,811
They looked away, but they sat silently.

538
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,539
Except for one woman
with her five-year-old daughter.

539
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,888
I heard the little girl say:

540
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,105
"Mama, that man's crazy.
I'm scared".

541
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,255
But the woman said:
"No, he's not crazy.

542
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,341
He's just very, very sad".

543
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,322
I sold my invention
to a foreign company.

544
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,765
Today it's used in almost half
of all cell phones.

545
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,447
I work there.
But that's not important.

546
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,539
The woman is now my wife
and the girl is my daughter.

547
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,507
We also have a son.

548
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,717
He's 4 years old.

549
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,848
Are you done?

550
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,343
No, there's more.

551
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,900
Maybe that kid should...

552
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,521
...die in prison.

553
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,031
Maybe that's his fate. Who knows?

554
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,575
Me, I should have died in the gutter.
But I didn't.

555
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,222
Because one person, just one...

556
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,221
...looked at me a little more closely...

557
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,533
...than everyone else

558
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:20,540
And didn't let me remain...

559
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,667
...in my lonely wretchedness.

560
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,248
Now I'm done.

561
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,152
Well...

562
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,551
That's a touching story of salvation,

563
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,732
but it's your story.

564
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,741
And you didn't kill anyone.

565
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,982
But this is a story of murder

566
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,579
Testimony from the old man
in the apartment below...

567
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:14,144
...who heard arguing,
and the boy yelling "I'll kill you".

568
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,426
The boy says he didn't kill
his adoptive father.

569
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,545
What would he say? "I killed him"?

570
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,361
- Then we wouldn't be here.
- His words seemed sincere.

571
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,787
He can barely express himself
in Russian.

572
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,882
What? Enough already!

573
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,328
What are you saying? Listen!

574
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,035
I don't give a damn
how he speaks Russian.

575
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,851
But excuse me. You're all adults.

576
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,002
Shame on you! Look around!

577
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,600
It's not our city anymore.
They've taken over.

578
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:47,916
Everything! The markets, casinos,
hotels. It's all theirs.

579
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,049
Yesterday I tried to drive down
Theater St. In my taxi.

580
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,201
Eight lanes!
Eight lanes, all full!

581
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,346
Full of their Bentley-shmentleys,
Mercedes.

582
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,347
It was some kind of wedding.

583
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,660
Songs! Dancing!
I thought they'd start shooting in the air.

584
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,872
And this was a 3-minute walk
from the Kremlin!

585
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,884
This isn't Moscow anymore.
It's Baku-shmaku, whatever...

586
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,337
And me, a native Muscovite,

587
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:18,410
I feel like an alien in my own city.

588
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,112
And the boy?
What about him?

589
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,370
You're trying to defend him, right?

590
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,407
Remember how they said...

591
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:29,181
...he argued with his father
the day before?

592
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,171
Imagine a Russian kid.
What would a Russian kid do?

593
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,107
He might get angry, curse him out...

594
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,202
...maybe run away.

595
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,107
But he wouldn't pick up a knife.

596
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,453
But that savage, your boy,
that animal...

597
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:48,759
...he'd hide his anger and then go back
to cut his throat and stab him!

598
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,843
I've heard enough.

599
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,111
Savage? We live in the 21st century,
you know?

600
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,841
And there's no need to exaggerate.

601
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,412
It's an enormous job we're doing.

602
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,410
We? Who's we? Who? Who's we?

603
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,855
- Democratic forces.
- What?

604
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,661
What kind of forces?
Oh, Lord.

605
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,763
I agree.

606
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,521
I'm not talking about that, I mean...

607
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,671
They're bastards. Bastards.

608
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,776
One on one they're OK,
but if there's more of them...

609
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,832
One time I was on a train, on vacation.

610
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,946
Four of those animals, one with a knife.

611
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,395
They robbed me.
Two were holding my arms,

612
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:38,266
and one went through my pockets.

613
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,104
I wasn't really scared,
I was just nervous.

614
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,475
One gassed me, right in the nose.

615
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:51,132
I came to in Simferopol.

616
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,926
Later, I saw 2 of them
in the market in Alushta...

617
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,922
They recognized me...

618
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,680
...and started to lick my sandals.

619
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:03,696
Our people surrounded them.

620
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,156
I was disgusted. I grabbed them
and carried them.

621
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,852
I kicked them in the ass.

622
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,685
I twisted my ankle and
barely made it home.

623
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,401
And now I have pain in my groin.
Are you a doctor?

624
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,337
- I'm a surgeon.
- Thank you.

625
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,236
I don't need a surgeon yet,
I use a salve.

626
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,866
They're bastards.
Bastards.

627
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,608
If he didn't kill him, what difference
does it make how he speaks Russian...

628
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,631
...esteemed gentlemen of the jury?

629
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,983
That's right.

630
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,998
Do you like it?

631
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,907
Yeah.

632
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,823
Look how pretty it is.

633
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:59,197
Thanks.

634
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:21,696
Umar!

635
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,213
Go home!

636
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,933
Go home and do your homework.
Volodya.

637
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,281
Sorry, my father's calling me.
Homework.

638
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,031
Don't worry. You'll get your chance
to fight the Russians.

639
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,370
Hey, friend,
school won't teach him to fight.

640
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,212
What'd you say, friend?
You mind your own business.

641
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,412
We'll deal with this at home
by ourselves.

642
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,317
Volodya, go home. Umar.

643
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,803
Come here, little wolf.

644
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,563
Let's go.

645
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,966
He who has hidden his head under his wife's
petticoat will never find his head again.

646
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:40,820
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

647
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,611
By the way, I asked them to bring
the knife from the murder.

648
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,318
Why?

649
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:19,764
In court they kept stressing that
it was an unusual knife, special.

650
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:23,277
And that...

651
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,757
Thank you.

652
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,147
And that only that kid had one.

653
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:35,047
You remember?

654
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:38,665
In court they kept saying that it was...

655
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,157
...a unique knife.

656
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,752
Special.

657
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:46,793
Here.

658
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,323
Let me see.

659
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,926
Yeah. This is a specialized knife.

660
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,120
Used by some units
of the special forces.

661
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,150
Similar to the American model
CQC-7 "hand to hand combat".

662
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,487
Made by Ernst Emerson.

663
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,998
It's monogrammed.

664
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,321
The kid could've brought this knife
from Chechnya.

665
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,163
They're black market there.

666
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,242
You can't buy a knife like this
in Moscow.

667
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:28,464
This knife has devastating
stabbing power.

668
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:32,442
Oh my!

669
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,035
PAPA
MAMA

670
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:42,516
It's that...

671
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:44,402
A major in the special forces.

672
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:50,358
His unit was fighting in the area
where the defendant lived.

673
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,347
Later he adopted him.

674
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:55,202
Did you lose something?

675
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,879
- Hey, what if...
- No.

676
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,425
Those soldiers were the ones
who killed the boy's parents?

677
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,960
That's motive. Motive for murder.
Oh God. Revenge.

678
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,089
Yes, but he had known the boy
since he was 5...

679
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:11,002
...and was a family friend.

680
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:14,555
What about the knife.
Do we know whose it is?

681
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:16,311
There are initials on it.

682
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,330
No, the initials don't match
anyone in the case.

683
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,142
It's a rare knife. It was kept at home.

684
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,936
The kid carried it with him all the time.

685
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,289
His friends saw him with it.
They said all this in court.

686
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:34,125
They kept saying it was
an exceptionally rare knife.

687
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,947
Special.

688
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:39,225
Just listen to what you're suggesting.

689
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,583
What is it?

690
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,792
- Can't find it.
- The kid's in the park.

691
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,598
Just walking, walking...

692
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,840
And suddenly some guy
comes up to him and says:

693
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:55,914
"Hey kid, do you happen to know
where they sell good knives?"

694
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,153
And he says: "Why, yes! I have
a good knife right here. A very good one.

695
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,532
Rare. Unique. Yes".

696
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:05,722
And he sells it to him. Yes.

697
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,880
The boy sold him this knife. The man
bought it and went and killed his dad!

698
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:14,631
It's totally lun-icrous!

699
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,135
- What?
- "Lud-icrous".

700
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,919
Wait, wait!

701
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,686
What about the money?

702
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,520
They found 7 thousand in his pocket!

703
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,567
The same exact amount as...

704
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,424
...the pension the father received that day.
He didn't sell any knife!

705
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:36,585
He killed him and robbed him.

706
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,786
There's no sense in listening
to the defendant's lies...

707
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,316
- You can't get another knife like that, guys.
- I found it!

708
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,571
Thank God. The key is tiny,
I thought I lost it.

709
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:50,870
But it was hiding
in my pocket. There...

710
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,816
I also thought that the knife
was unique, special.

711
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,862
And that only he had one.

712
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,427
Look.

713
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,708
Here.

714
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:12,518
One and the same.

715
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,047
With a receipt.

716
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,691
They said it's unique, special
and that only he had one.

717
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,792
At the "Extreme" market
you can get one easily.

718
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:37,797
So what's that prove?

719
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,867
That the Chechen
didn't kill his father?

720
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:43,746
No, it proves nothing.
Can we smoke here?

721
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,457
Why not? We're locked in.

722
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:48,197
- Ashtray.
- May I?

723
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,166
- Thanks. I had a different goal.
- So you found the knife.

724
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,596
- Bought it.
- OK, bought. What's the difference?

725
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,241
These days you can even buy
a missile launcher.

726
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,221
But can you tell me how that proves...

727
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,336
...that the man who bought the knife
also killed the father?

728
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,621
May I? It doesn't prove that at all.
You interrupted me before.

729
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,673
Thank you.

730
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,053
I'm saying that the uniqueness
of the knife was...

731
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:19,680
...the prosecution's main argument.

732
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,542
But it turns out you can buy one easily.

733
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,216
So what? What does that mean?

734
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,599
It means the investigation wasn't very
thorough so other facts are possible.

735
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,304
The lawyer. The lawyer. He had nothing to say.
He was an empty man!

736
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,897
He couldn't defend him.

737
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,456
What...? What if...

738
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:43,537
...the one who bought it is the killer?

739
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:45,677
Oh, Jesus!

740
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,255
Buddy, why do you have
cottage cheese for brains?

741
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:53,131
Someone bought it and killed him.

742
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,902
Do you even understand
what you're saying?

743
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,401
Five minutes ago you drew us
a balance sheet.

744
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:03,290
"He killed and robbed him".
Who else had a reason...

745
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,897
...to kill a major for his pension?

746
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,743
If I were you I'd listen to the comrade
from the Transport Authority.

747
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,441
You know, your reasoning is somehow...

748
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:15,577
Jewish.

749
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,691
What, I should reason
like the late Yasser Arafat?

750
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,582
All right. No, well...
Wait a minute. Wait.

751
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,696
OK. So the working guy
said something stupid.

752
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:31,391
- Why are you supporting him?
- You know, what he said wasn't stupid.

753
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,465
See, that's a typical Jewish trick.

754
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,157
If a non-Jew says something stupid,
it's OK, but...

755
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,062
...if it's a Jew, it's not stupid.

756
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:42,427
All right.

757
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,735
The knife, a coincidence. It's the same,
I admit. But the man who bought the knife

758
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,997
used it to kill the father.

759
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:52,696
Is that also a coincidence?

760
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:56,265
2 coincidences in a row?
That's impossible.

761
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,488
It never happens. Never.

762
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:03,639
You know, for some time now
I've believed that...

763
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,722
...anything is possible in life.
Absolutely anything. Even the impossible.

764
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,472
My dad...

765
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,366
...was in the ghetto during the War.

766
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,790
- A Holocaust story?
- No, it's about my dad.

767
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,135
The headquarters of the
Lithuanian SS was right nearby.

768
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,910
And there was an SS officer there
who had a beautiful Lithuanian wife.

769
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,770
Now, my dad was a scrawny man.

770
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,691
You see what I look like?
He was three times worse.

771
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,991
And did you inherit your dad's looks?

772
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:44,300
No, my mom's. Mom was no beauty,
either, but not like dad.

773
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,376
It made it that much easier
for my father to fall in love.

774
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,771
My father fell in love with that
beautiful Lithuanian woman.

775
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,199
And she fell in love with my father,
like a puppy.

776
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,370
Imagine what would've happened
if the Russians had lost.

777
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:05,181
The SS officer fled to Germany.

778
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,102
And she stayed with my dad.

779
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:10,222
Oh, God, wow!

780
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,340
They were both arrested
and sent to the camps in Siberia.

781
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,576
They were released in 1953,
found each other, and got married.

782
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:22,176
They moved to a little farm
near Vilnius...

783
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,535
...and began to crank out children.
Eleven of them.

784
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,229
By this time, of course, my dad had been
a pig and dumped my mom.

785
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,533
But I understand him.

786
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,918
For one thing...

787
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,496
...I saw her photograph.

788
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:49,016
I saw her photograph.

789
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:54,407
And for another...

790
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,062
...my mother was no angel, either.

791
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:03,362
Mother was no angel.

792
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,493
An amazing story.

793
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,715
If someone told me a story like that,
I wouldn't believe it.

794
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,701
But it happened to my dad.

795
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:26,241
Anything can happen.

796
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:29,038
Anything.

797
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:12,309
Stop, stop. I have doubts.
We all tend our gardens in our own way.

798
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,637
And we hold the shovel in our own.

799
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,206
Well... If you only knew.
I have an uncle.

800
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,865
He lives near Voronezh, he's a plumber.

801
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,843
Hands of gold!

802
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,795
He's generous and kind.
The whole city just loves him.

803
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,447
He likes to drink,
but he's not mean.

804
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:39,420
He doesn't drink too often.

805
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,777
In the center of town

806
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,133
there's a square.

807
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:50,110
They built this place there where
you can play machines for money.

808
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,742
"Brother," it's called. "Brother".

809
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:58,324
Uncle Kolya had never been a gambler.
But one payday, he got drunk.

810
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,873
And went there.

811
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,991
And, well, he lost.

812
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,726
He lost every cent.

813
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:11,595
He thinks: "How can I go home now

814
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,292
to Liuba, to my wife, and say:

815
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,416
"Liuba, I lost everything, all the money".
How?"

816
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,096
It'd be easier to hang himself.

817
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,056
But some kind people told him:

818
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,416
"There's a place nearby
where you can borrow money".

819
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,144
So he goes there and they say:
"OK, we'll give you a loan,

820
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:39,583
but with high interest,
and not less than 50 thousand.

821
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:44,343
So if you want 50 thousand, you got it,
but if not, you can go to hell".

822
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,277
What could he do?

823
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,472
He takes the 50 thousand...

824
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:53,814
...and goes back to that
"Brother" place, damn it.

825
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,068
And he...

826
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,942
He loses it all.

827
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,242
The whole 50 thousand.
Now what could he do?

828
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:06,025
Now what was he going to do?

829
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:15,191
Middle of the day.

830
01:03:17,272 --> 01:03:19,604
He goes to work, tells the boss:

831
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:22,909
"Give me 50 thousand".
"What, are you nuts?"

832
01:03:23,073 --> 01:03:27,498
"Nuts, eh? Just you wait."
He goes home. Gets a shotgun, shells.

833
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:31,069
And goes back. By this time
the boss had run off some place.

834
01:03:31,232 --> 01:03:34,463
He goes to the accounting office.
There are only women there.

835
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:38,029
He takes three of them hostage.

836
01:03:38,192 --> 01:03:40,899
He becomes a terrorist.

837
01:03:42,513 --> 01:03:45,744
He makes them put
a bucket outside with a note,

838
01:03:45,913 --> 01:03:49,519
his demands -
all 57 thousand rubles,

839
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:54,848
a luxury apartment,
a job as chief engineer,

840
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:58,554
and a plane to anywhere on earth
he chooses.

841
01:03:58,712 --> 01:04:01,249
Now, why did he ask for a job,

842
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:04,909
when he planned to fly off in a plane?

843
01:04:05,073 --> 01:04:07,780
That's not important.
It's not important.

844
01:04:08,993 --> 01:04:12,599
The women say: "Uncle Kolya,
what are you doing? Look..."

845
01:04:13,073 --> 01:04:15,735
But he just goes "oooo!"
He can't speak.

846
01:04:15,913 --> 01:04:20,373
The women open the safe
and take out 800 rubles.

847
01:04:20,513 --> 01:04:23,425
One goes to buy vodka,
a half case, ice cream.

848
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:26,096
And the police are there, snipers.

849
01:04:26,272 --> 01:04:28,854
"He's a terrorist! Get him! Fire!"

850
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:33,618
But the police chief says:
"Stop! Absolutely not! Don't shoot!

851
01:04:33,752 --> 01:04:35,845
I'll go myself!"
What a man!

852
01:04:36,033 --> 01:04:38,740
And he goes in unarmed. What a man!

853
01:04:38,913 --> 01:04:41,495
Uncle Kolya points the gun at him:
"I'll kill you".

854
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:43,594
And the chief says: "No you won't".

855
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:48,547
"Why not?"
"Because I'm the chief", says the chief.

856
01:04:48,672 --> 01:04:51,698
Uncle Kolya drops the shotgun.

857
01:04:52,553 --> 01:04:56,080
They sit around the case of vodka.

858
01:04:56,872 --> 01:04:58,715
They have a drink.

859
01:04:58,953 --> 01:05:00,750
And cry.

860
01:05:01,712 --> 01:05:04,988
And there was no trial, no investigation.

861
01:05:19,553 --> 01:05:23,853
I beg your pardon, but why exactly
did you tell us all that?

862
01:05:23,993 --> 01:05:28,703
Why? He could have been sent to prison,

863
01:05:28,872 --> 01:05:30,920
or shot. A terrorist!

864
01:05:31,152 --> 01:05:34,918
But the police chief, what a man.
What a man! Nothing.

865
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:39,533
Uncle Kolya worked and paid off his debt.
I helped a bit.

866
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:43,034
The police chief moved up.
He became a businessman.

867
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:46,349
And "Brother" was burned down.

868
01:05:46,553 --> 01:05:48,805
But by someone else,
not Uncle Kolya.

869
01:05:48,993 --> 01:05:51,325
That's wonderful.

870
01:05:51,633 --> 01:05:56,297
But what does all that have to do
with this case?

871
01:05:57,232 --> 01:05:58,915
If... if...

872
01:06:00,993 --> 01:06:02,711
I'm for kindness.

873
01:06:03,232 --> 01:06:06,099
Your brains sure curdled fast, brother.

874
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:09,839
No, no.
I don't have cottage cheese up here!

875
01:06:09,993 --> 01:06:13,269
A good man should be helped.

876
01:06:13,393 --> 01:06:15,315
And a bad man should be...

877
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:21,499
I vote that the young Chechen
is not guilty.

878
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:23,316
Write it down. Thank you.

879
01:06:24,553 --> 01:06:25,861
Well!

880
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:28,555
That's amazing!

881
01:06:28,993 --> 01:06:32,110
What kind of justice is that?

882
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:35,420
Uncle Kolya the plumber
runs around drunk.

883
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:39,034
Uncle Lyosha the police chief
drinks vodka with him.

884
01:06:39,152 --> 01:06:43,122
Uncle Vasya the city prosecutor
turns a blind eye.

885
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,894
And the criminal remains at large!

886
01:06:47,993 --> 01:06:51,019
And meanwhile the entire
civilized world

887
01:06:51,152 --> 01:06:54,838
has lived for centuries
according to the law.

888
01:06:58,073 --> 01:07:01,019
A Russian man will
never live by the law.

889
01:07:01,152 --> 01:07:04,588
- Why not?
- The law bores him.

890
01:07:06,152 --> 01:07:08,074
The law is dead.

891
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,735
There's nothing personal about it.

892
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:14,929
And a Russian man without that
personal touch is an empty shell.

893
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,870
He won't steal or guard.

894
01:07:17,152 --> 01:07:19,154
But that's awful!

895
01:07:19,312 --> 01:07:21,405
Who said it was good?

896
01:07:21,553 --> 01:07:23,805
Look at that horrible pipe.

897
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:26,475
It's obscene.

898
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:29,090
Total filth in the center of Moscow.

899
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,928
In a school,
where they teach children.

900
01:07:32,152 --> 01:07:35,349
The builders forgot to run
a proper heating pipe,

901
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:37,930
and then the school was built.

902
01:07:38,152 --> 01:07:41,349
They should cut off their limbs
and put them in prison.

903
01:07:41,473 --> 01:07:42,781
By law.

904
01:07:42,993 --> 01:07:47,544
But there are personal ties.
Human ones. Russian ones.

905
01:07:47,712 --> 01:07:52,627
The school let them temporarily
hang that thing. Temporarily.

906
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:57,707
And it has a corrosive effect
on the minds of the children.

907
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:01,023
Maybe that's why they leave
their bras in the bathroom.

908
01:08:01,232 --> 01:08:03,564
And nobody gets steamed up.

909
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,169
What's the law got to do with it?

910
01:08:06,993 --> 01:08:08,881
Human relations.

911
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,885
Here! You'll love this.

912
01:08:17,153 --> 01:08:20,680
Inventory number 72-17-99.

913
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:23,079
Young Eagle Pioneer Camp.

914
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,645
1967.

915
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:27,915
I wasn't even born then.

916
01:08:29,233 --> 01:08:31,406
Do you see how it is?

917
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:34,170
40 years have passed. 40 years!

918
01:08:34,313 --> 01:08:36,645
And we still can't wake up
from the coma.

919
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:41,103
4 decades of running in place.

920
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:48,124
That's it. I missed my train.
The troupe left without me.

921
01:08:48,393 --> 01:08:51,100
But I'm here. And I'm voting.

922
01:08:52,072 --> 01:08:55,269
The young Chechen is not guilty.

923
01:08:56,473 --> 01:08:58,156
Write it down. Period.

924
01:08:58,872 --> 01:09:00,305
Shit...

925
01:09:00,473 --> 01:09:03,180
What are you...? Aw, hell!
What did... See what you did?

926
01:09:03,712 --> 01:09:08,058
- This is a circus?
- Actually, I'll join them! Write that, too!

927
01:09:08,153 --> 01:09:10,405
Let's all join them!

928
01:09:10,872 --> 01:09:14,603
- Wonderful...
- I also think the kid's not guilty!

929
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:20,862
And, incidentally,
I have reasonable doubts.

930
01:09:21,313 --> 01:09:25,204
Can you explain why

931
01:09:25,313 --> 01:09:28,339
if he killed and robbed
his adoptive father...

932
01:09:29,393 --> 01:09:33,614
...he returned with the money
to the scene of the crime?

933
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:35,065
Yes, good point.

934
01:09:36,233 --> 01:09:38,895
Atypical murderer wouldn't do that.

935
01:09:39,153 --> 01:09:41,485
Listen, just listen.

936
01:09:41,712 --> 01:09:45,034
OK, you're a respectable man,
a college dean.

937
01:09:45,153 --> 01:09:49,123
How can you say that?
What does "typical murderer" mean?

938
01:09:49,313 --> 01:09:51,486
Atypical one wouldn't go back,
but this one did,

939
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:55,018
because he's a stupid,
uneducated savage

940
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,406
who just jumped out of the tree.

941
01:09:57,712 --> 01:10:00,658
You expect him to write novels?

942
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:04,353
You know perfectly well,
those animals have tiny little bird brains.

943
01:10:04,553 --> 01:10:05,702
My dear sir...

944
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:09,518
...excuse me, but just who
are you calling a savage?

945
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:11,726
I'm also from the Caucasus,
for example.

946
01:10:11,872 --> 01:10:14,898
So the poet Rustaveli was a savage?

947
01:10:15,072 --> 01:10:18,838
The artist Pirosmani?
Directors like Paradzhanov?

948
01:10:18,992 --> 01:10:21,813
- Who's a savage?
- I don't mean them.

949
01:10:21,992 --> 01:10:25,758
I'm talking about the monster
who killed his father.

950
01:10:25,912 --> 01:10:28,324
I'm talking about myself.

951
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:31,499
I'm also from the Caucasus.
I studied in Moscow.

952
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:35,524
But I get called "monkey".
I'm no monkey, I'm a surgeon.

953
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:39,364
A physician. I have my own clinic.
Understand?

954
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:43,694
I don't doubt it, OK, so you're not
toiling away at county hospital.

955
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:48,377
Then why do people come here
from the Caucasus to buy a diploma?

956
01:10:49,072 --> 01:10:50,869
What? To buy what?

957
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:53,734
- I bought one?
- I don't mean you.

958
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:57,103
I'm asking you, wait!
I bought my diploma, yes?

959
01:10:57,992 --> 01:11:01,928
I never paid anyone
to get where I am!

960
01:11:02,072 --> 01:11:05,189
How dare you?
What gives you the right, huh?

961
01:11:05,313 --> 01:11:09,363
I tried 4 times before I got into
Moscow Medical School!

962
01:11:09,553 --> 01:11:15,082
And for all 4 years I worked
as an orderly at city hospital! Yes!

963
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:20,398
I worked as a paramedic and in the ER.
I graduated in honor! "With honors" I mean.

964
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:23,909
Yes,
so I don't speak Russian that well.

965
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:27,189
So what?
Yes, I said "lun-icrous" by mistake.

966
01:11:27,553 --> 01:11:30,909
So what? I apologized.
I'm still a good doctor!

967
01:11:31,072 --> 01:11:34,018
I don't doubt that you're a good doctor.
But I don't understand why

968
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:37,100
a good doctor like you
would vote guilty

969
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:41,044
if everyone in the Caucasus
is so cultured...

970
01:11:41,153 --> 01:11:43,405
That's why I voted guilty.

971
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:47,114
It's an unheard of affront
in the Caucasus

972
01:11:47,313 --> 01:11:49,645
to raise a hand against an elder.

973
01:11:49,792 --> 01:11:52,818
Especially if he took you
into his home, his family.

974
01:11:53,712 --> 01:11:55,065
Brothers, brothers...

975
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:58,156
Gentlemen... Comrades...

976
01:11:58,553 --> 01:12:01,340
Come on, let's be civilized.
For God's sake.

977
01:12:01,473 --> 01:12:04,340
I'm over here writing, plus one,
not guilty, guilty...

978
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,726
...let's be civilized, let's do it again.

979
01:12:06,912 --> 01:12:10,757
Let's all vote calmly.
We'll write everything down so it's clear.

980
01:12:10,992 --> 01:12:14,268
- So let's vote, OK?
- Can we vote by show of hands?

981
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:16,236
Now. Who votes

982
01:12:16,473 --> 01:12:20,933
to find the accused not guilty?

983
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:26,372
Not guilty. Please pay attention.
Not guilty.

984
01:12:26,553 --> 01:12:27,861
One,

985
01:12:28,072 --> 01:12:31,599
two, three, four,

986
01:12:32,072 --> 01:12:33,300
five.

987
01:12:33,712 --> 01:12:37,193
Who votes to find the defendant guilty?

988
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:41,669
One, two, three, four, five,

989
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:43,225
six...

990
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:45,622
Seven.

991
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:47,475
Seven "for"...

992
01:12:47,792 --> 01:12:50,943
Five for "not guilty",
seven for "guilty".

993
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:57,217
The boundary is here, right?
So it's a mirror image.

994
01:14:57,313 --> 01:14:59,156
Let's reproduce it.

995
01:14:59,313 --> 01:15:04,558
So your amateur theatre is going to
recreate the crime scene exactly?

996
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:08,683
Exactly? No, how could we?
One apartment was on top of the other.

997
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:13,377
We'll try to mirror-image them,
according to this floor plan.

998
01:15:13,553 --> 01:15:18,058
Listen, the old man downstairs heard
the boy shout "I'll kill you".

999
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:22,124
And a falling body
and he saw the boy run away, right?

1000
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:27,297
Have any of you been
to the scene of the murder?

1001
01:15:27,473 --> 01:15:28,701
Of course not.

1002
01:15:28,912 --> 01:15:33,053
You know, I have...
I went after the first day of the trial...

1003
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,871
because I was curious to see

1004
01:15:35,473 --> 01:15:39,523
a building where only two apartments
were occupied.

1005
01:15:39,712 --> 01:15:43,682
In one, a murder, in the other,
a witness to the murder.

1006
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,225
And nobody else.

1007
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:48,590
What's that got to do
with this case?

1008
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:52,352
Next to the building
there's a construction site.

1009
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:56,444
They're building luxury apartments.
There's lots of machinery.

1010
01:15:56,553 --> 01:16:00,444
- They work around the clock.
- Around the clock. So what?

1011
01:16:00,553 --> 01:16:05,138
Imagine the noise
of a building site outside your window.

1012
01:16:05,313 --> 01:16:06,541
Your point?

1013
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:09,943
The old man claims he heard
the boy shout "I'll kill you"

1014
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:15,477
and then he heard something fall,
and he says he recognized the boy's voice.

1015
01:16:15,633 --> 01:16:17,146
Yeah, so? What? What?

1016
01:16:17,633 --> 01:16:22,707
With all due respect to the witness,
I don't believe him.

1017
01:16:22,872 --> 01:16:25,818
Wait. One second.
So you're telling us

1018
01:16:25,992 --> 01:16:29,837
that the old man knowingly lied in court,
under oath?

1019
01:16:29,992 --> 01:16:32,085
An old-school communist

1020
01:16:32,313 --> 01:16:36,124
slandered an innocent Chechen boy
for no reason?

1021
01:16:36,233 --> 01:16:40,693
If anyone lied, under oath and otherwise,
it was the communists.

1022
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:44,763
They lied from top to bottom,
every one of them.

1023
01:16:44,912 --> 01:16:48,518
For privileges, for power,
and just out of habit.

1024
01:16:48,712 --> 01:16:52,113
Let's not talk about that, please.

1025
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:54,315
Some people were different.

1026
01:16:54,473 --> 01:16:57,499
My father was a regional party secretary
in the Urals.

1027
01:16:57,633 --> 01:17:00,579
Privileges? What privileges?

1028
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:05,047
Sometimes we didn't see him for years.
His heart was shot at 50.

1029
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:08,429
After he retired,
he burned out within 3 months.

1030
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:12,273
They spit him out like old gum.
Privileges, you say?

1031
01:17:12,473 --> 01:17:15,089
How do you think it looks?

1032
01:17:15,912 --> 01:17:17,880
- Pretty close.
- Pretty close.

1033
01:17:18,313 --> 01:17:22,534
Now, we've created two identical
apartments in mirror image.

1034
01:17:22,633 --> 01:17:26,524
As I said, one's on top of the other,
so they're identical.

1035
01:17:26,872 --> 01:17:29,659
In his testimony the old man said

1036
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:33,348
that at the time of the crime
he was lying...

1037
01:17:34,153 --> 01:17:37,759
...on the living room sofa...
No, I can't see anything.

1038
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:39,880
I'll ask the bailiff.

1039
01:17:46,393 --> 01:17:47,781
What's that?

1040
01:17:47,992 --> 01:17:51,018
The train. I'll call you back.

1041
01:17:58,872 --> 01:18:00,146
Oh Lord!

1042
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:07,339
- You rang?
- Can you turn on the light?

1043
01:18:07,553 --> 01:18:10,010
We need to read. It's an experiment.

1044
01:18:10,233 --> 01:18:12,076
It's nighttime.

1045
01:18:13,872 --> 01:18:16,488
All right, I'll turn it on.

1046
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:27,885
You'll have light.

1047
01:18:29,473 --> 01:18:31,236
Yeltsin's fault.

1048
01:18:34,072 --> 01:18:35,460
Thank you.

1049
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:36,895
Thank you, Boris.

1050
01:18:37,153 --> 01:18:39,895
The old man was lying right here
on the sofa.

1051
01:18:40,072 --> 01:18:41,994
The crime happened here.

1052
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:46,454
He said his living room is
under the room where the murder was.

1053
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:50,444
Did anyone notice how the old man
walked to the stand?

1054
01:18:50,553 --> 01:18:54,603
Yes, I remember very well!
He walked slowly, his knees didn't bend.

1055
01:18:54,712 --> 01:18:56,475
Because he has arthritis.

1056
01:18:56,872 --> 01:19:00,273
The floor plan shows
all the room dimensions.

1057
01:19:00,473 --> 01:19:05,797
And we've reproduced them almost exactly,

1058
01:19:05,872 --> 01:19:07,874
to see he had to get up from the sofa,

1059
01:19:08,393 --> 01:19:12,204
walk 35 meters, open the door,

1060
01:19:12,473 --> 01:19:14,805
and still manage to see someone.

1061
01:19:14,992 --> 01:19:19,372
- Anyone know average walking speed?
- A meter and a half per second.

1062
01:19:19,553 --> 01:19:22,260
- A meter and a half.
- If you're healthy.

1063
01:19:22,393 --> 01:19:25,009
So, 10 seconds is 15 meters.

1064
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:26,871
So 35 meters is about 25 seconds.

1065
01:19:27,072 --> 01:19:31,782
And we'll see which one of us
gets to the door first.

1066
01:19:32,153 --> 01:19:34,815
But you have to walk like him.

1067
01:19:35,992 --> 01:19:39,758
Pardon me, gentlemen.
I could time you.

1068
01:19:39,912 --> 01:19:41,300
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

1069
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:42,861
Thank you, as well.

1070
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:46,326
You're the old man on the sofa.
I'm the criminal.

1071
01:19:46,553 --> 01:19:50,603
It should take you 2 seconds
to get up and find your slippers.

1072
01:19:50,712 --> 01:19:52,805
Start when I say so.

1073
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:56,499
- Action!
- I'll kill you!

1074
01:19:59,072 --> 01:20:01,734
- What's going on?
- Stop, stop.

1075
01:20:02,473 --> 01:20:06,034
- Excuse me, you're disturbing us.
- We're working here, see.

1076
01:20:06,153 --> 01:20:10,294
No problem. Thank you.
We're doing an experiment. Sorry.

1077
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,792
It's OK. Start again.

1078
01:20:18,992 --> 01:20:21,324
Reset the clock to zero.

1079
01:20:21,553 --> 01:20:22,861
Zero.

1080
01:20:23,072 --> 01:20:24,221
- Ready?
- Yes.

1081
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,066
Attention...

1082
01:20:27,872 --> 01:20:30,409
- Action!
- I'll kill you!

1083
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:34,165
- Get up.
- OK. There's a noise.

1084
01:20:34,313 --> 01:20:36,315
The knife. There are prints.

1085
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:38,316
Come on, old man, up!

1086
01:20:38,553 --> 01:20:40,316
You hear a noise.
Something's up.

1087
01:20:40,553 --> 01:20:43,829
No, wait.
You have to wipe off the prints.

1088
01:20:43,992 --> 01:20:46,244
Wipe off the fingerprints completely.

1089
01:20:46,393 --> 01:20:49,419
Come on, old man, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

1090
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,316
I wipe off the fingerprints.

1091
01:20:52,072 --> 01:20:55,269
You have to take the money.
You need to find it.

1092
01:20:55,473 --> 01:20:57,805
Old man, come on, come on, let's go!

1093
01:20:57,992 --> 01:20:58,970
Let's go!

1094
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:02,100
But the boy would know
where the money is.

1095
01:21:04,313 --> 01:21:06,725
OK, I look for the money.
I'm looking for it.

1096
01:21:06,872 --> 01:21:09,739
I think that's enough time
to find the money.

1097
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:11,470
Don't forget, put on your coat.

1098
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,579
Come on, old man, something's up,
come on.

1099
01:21:14,712 --> 01:21:17,089
- Someone's shouting.
- Parasites...

1100
01:21:17,233 --> 01:21:19,940
I put on my jacket. I button it. I walk.

1101
01:21:21,712 --> 01:21:23,885
I walk. I'm in the other room now.

1102
01:21:25,712 --> 01:21:27,714
I open the door, I run.

1103
01:21:28,473 --> 01:21:31,010
I open another door.
I'm in the hall.

1104
01:21:34,153 --> 01:21:37,270
I open the door. I'm on the stairs.

1105
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:40,829
Seven stairs,
three steps on the landing.

1106
01:21:40,912 --> 01:21:43,324
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
1, 2, 3.

1107
01:21:44,712 --> 01:21:47,579
The old man's apartment
1, 2. That's all...

1108
01:21:52,233 --> 01:21:53,791
I'm outside!

1109
01:21:57,872 --> 01:22:00,170
But he only got as far as the door.

1110
01:22:00,313 --> 01:22:03,020
Add another 5 seconds for him
to unlock the door.

1111
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:06,475
53 seconds, gentlemen.

1112
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,710
53 seconds.

1113
01:22:22,712 --> 01:22:24,191
So what?

1114
01:22:26,952 --> 01:22:29,045
Maybe it was like that.

1115
01:22:30,672 --> 01:22:32,720
And maybe it wasn't.

1116
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:36,970
The police believed the old man.

1117
01:22:37,112 --> 01:22:42,072
And I believe the police.
The old man saw the kid running away.

1118
01:22:42,353 --> 01:22:44,935
Or someone else running away.

1119
01:22:45,072 --> 01:22:46,346
Who?

1120
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:50,374
Someone who wasn't in a hurry.

1121
01:22:50,513 --> 01:22:53,425
Someone who needed to be seen.

1122
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,032
Push up.

1123
01:22:58,832 --> 01:23:01,084
You know, I think...

1124
01:23:01,832 --> 01:23:06,587
...that an old man with
rheumatoid arthritis type 3 FNS 2

1125
01:23:06,672 --> 01:23:09,869
could never walk
that far in ten seconds.

1126
01:23:09,992 --> 01:23:11,630
I say that as a doctor.

1127
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:15,360
I want to vote.

1128
01:23:15,752 --> 01:23:19,483
I vote that the boy is not guilty.

1129
01:23:19,792 --> 01:23:21,305
Six - six.

1130
01:23:22,072 --> 01:23:23,255
And...

1131
01:23:25,672 --> 01:23:27,355
Me too.

1132
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:31,436
Seven -five.

1133
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:37,986
Seven -five.

1134
01:25:20,313 --> 01:25:22,611
- What is it?
- I'm cold.

1135
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:26,185
Cold? We're all cold, pal.

1136
01:25:26,353 --> 01:25:29,550
They gave you double bars.
But you're still cold.

1137
01:25:29,712 --> 01:25:31,430
Deal with it, pal.

1138
01:25:58,393 --> 01:26:02,818
"A birch, a rowan tree"

1139
01:26:03,513 --> 01:26:07,483
"A willow on the river bank"

1140
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,425
So, actor...

1141
01:26:09,593 --> 01:26:12,414
Your squad went to earn
some loot without you?

1142
01:26:12,553 --> 01:26:14,680
We call it "cleaning up".

1143
01:26:15,153 --> 01:26:18,020
"- Where could you find..."
- You performed here.

1144
01:26:18,353 --> 01:26:21,789
- For free, though.
- That's called a "command performance".

1145
01:26:24,633 --> 01:26:27,659
Did you switch sides as a joke?

1146
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:30,124
That's called "buffoonery".
Catch!

1147
01:26:33,112 --> 01:26:35,649
You... Hey. Sorry, I...

1148
01:26:38,832 --> 01:26:41,778
I didn't mean to.
I thought you'd catch it.

1149
01:26:44,353 --> 01:26:45,786
Listen...

1150
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,500
Listen.

1151
01:26:51,672 --> 01:26:53,515
Listen, you.

1152
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:57,943
Why are you always
talking to me like that?

1153
01:26:58,072 --> 01:26:59,346
I said sorry. OK...

1154
01:26:59,513 --> 01:27:01,765
Why do you do it?
Do we know each other?

1155
01:27:01,912 --> 01:27:03,675
Did we play football...

1156
01:27:03,832 --> 01:27:06,084
...or drink vodka or chase girls?

1157
01:27:06,273 --> 01:27:09,185
- What? Huh?
- And why do you always cackle?

1158
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:11,690
- Who cackles?
- You cackle. Why?

1159
01:27:12,153 --> 01:27:15,099
- Who cackles?
- You. All the time. Always cackling.

1160
01:27:15,233 --> 01:27:18,054
Why would I cackle?
We've been here 5 hours.

1161
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,871
You found yourself a clown, eh?

1162
01:27:20,593 --> 01:27:23,665
What am I, a clown to you?
A cheap clown?

1163
01:27:23,832 --> 01:27:25,595
I'm sick of your laughter!

1164
01:27:25,792 --> 01:27:29,728
You've all turned blue from cackling,
like you were strangled.

1165
01:27:29,992 --> 01:27:32,244
You always want to laugh.

1166
01:27:32,393 --> 01:27:36,693
You think it's funny.
You laugh everywhere at everything!

1167
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:41,738
Before you even sit in your seat
you're ready with your cackle.

1168
01:27:41,832 --> 01:27:43,959
You laugh at absolutely everything!

1169
01:27:44,112 --> 01:27:46,854
Life. Death. Tsunami.

1170
01:27:46,992 --> 01:27:49,984
Earthquakes! And you cackle!

1171
01:27:50,313 --> 01:27:52,361
Half the country's freezing...

1172
01:27:52,513 --> 01:27:56,734
A cop murders someone...
Five million homeless orphans...

1173
01:27:58,912 --> 01:28:02,348
Why are you laughing?
Why the "ha ha ha"?

1174
01:28:02,553 --> 01:28:05,374
Because being serious terrifies you.

1175
01:28:06,273 --> 01:28:08,321
Not long ago...

1176
01:28:08,752 --> 01:28:13,257
...I was performing and I started
to talk to the audience seriously.

1177
01:28:13,952 --> 01:28:16,978
About my life,
about life in Russia.

1178
01:28:17,553 --> 01:28:19,521
Everyone laughed.

1179
01:28:19,672 --> 01:28:22,334
They thought it was a joke.

1180
01:28:22,872 --> 01:28:25,739
I bet if I were to spit

1181
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:28,944
from the stage onto the first row,

1182
01:28:29,273 --> 01:28:33,653
they'd still laugh,
they'd think it was a joke.

1183
01:28:36,513 --> 01:28:38,925
Found yourself a clown?

1184
01:28:39,233 --> 01:28:41,326
I'm no clown.

1185
01:28:41,473 --> 01:28:44,419
I've only really earned one smile.

1186
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:47,329
One single smile.

1187
01:28:49,193 --> 01:28:52,879
When I was playing that old man.

1188
01:28:56,433 --> 01:29:00,278
As a kid, I stayed alone a lot
with my sick grandma.

1189
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:05,579
I was five or six, yeah, six.

1190
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:11,164
She collapsed.
I could tell she was dying.

1191
01:29:12,832 --> 01:29:16,188
I called an ambulance,
but it took forever.

1192
01:29:16,832 --> 01:29:18,834
I gave her medicine.

1193
01:29:20,872 --> 01:29:22,760
I was terrified.

1194
01:29:24,273 --> 01:29:26,889
She was my grandmother, after all.

1195
01:29:27,032 --> 01:29:29,569
I decided to cheer her up.

1196
01:29:29,872 --> 01:29:32,534
I started imitating
her neighbor, Sima,

1197
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:35,903
and another friend of hers.
They were both very funny.

1198
01:29:36,353 --> 01:29:41,222
Grandma was in a lot of pain
but I saw her smile.

1199
01:29:44,593 --> 01:29:50,042
Even when they were carrying her body
out, I saw a smile on her face.

1200
01:29:52,473 --> 01:29:54,316
All that...

1201
01:29:55,393 --> 01:29:56,985
...laughter...

1202
01:29:59,513 --> 01:30:01,276
...and a smile.

1203
01:30:07,072 --> 01:30:09,404
And that Chechen kid...

1204
01:30:12,153 --> 01:30:13,950
The old man...

1205
01:30:17,072 --> 01:30:19,984
I could feel in my bones...

1206
01:30:21,273 --> 01:30:23,366
...their horrible fear...

1207
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:26,986
...and loneliness.

1208
01:30:27,153 --> 01:30:31,374
Same as when I was with my grandmother
while she was dying.

1209
01:30:35,153 --> 01:30:37,895
That was the only smile

1210
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:40,770
I ever really earned.

1211
01:30:41,712 --> 01:30:43,964
Good thing there are mats.

1212
01:30:44,112 --> 01:30:46,615
I could've broken my back.

1213
01:31:18,992 --> 01:31:21,984
What a Russian story.

1214
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:29,066
Yeah.

1215
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:34,207
Everything here is very Russian somehow.
It's not Harvard.

1216
01:31:34,792 --> 01:31:36,680
Yes. It's not Harvard.

1217
01:31:39,313 --> 01:31:41,440
Really got to you, huh?

1218
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:45,531
Hey, let's do one more experiment.

1219
01:31:46,553 --> 01:31:51,388
You did an experiment.
I just want to check one thing.

1220
01:31:52,912 --> 01:31:54,755
Now, just imagine...

1221
01:31:55,752 --> 01:31:57,640
You have an imagination, right?

1222
01:31:57,832 --> 01:31:58,981
Me?

1223
01:31:59,433 --> 01:32:03,199
It's not bad. It's...
It's part of my profession.

1224
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:05,645
Naturally! Yeah!
Now, imagine...

1225
01:32:06,593 --> 01:32:08,515
...you're coming home.

1226
01:32:09,032 --> 01:32:11,000
Late at night.

1227
01:32:11,153 --> 01:32:13,246
- Are you married?
- I am.

1228
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:15,145
Hold this, please.

1229
01:32:15,313 --> 01:32:18,020
- Do you have kids?
- Yes. A little girl.

1230
01:32:18,353 --> 01:32:21,220
- What kind of car?
- An Audi-80.

1231
01:32:22,273 --> 01:32:25,800
So, imagine that you're coming home
late one night.

1232
01:32:26,593 --> 01:32:29,460
You live in a good area,
nice building, right?

1233
01:32:29,672 --> 01:32:33,028
With a concierge, security cameras,
and everything,

1234
01:32:33,153 --> 01:32:37,169
secure parking lot,
a gate, a guard.

1235
01:32:37,792 --> 01:32:39,475
I have a keychain alarm.

1236
01:32:39,633 --> 01:32:41,885
Kolya the guard...

1237
01:32:42,032 --> 01:32:44,125
His name is Kolya.

1238
01:32:44,273 --> 01:32:45,956
Uncle Petya the custodian.

1239
01:32:46,112 --> 01:32:47,795
- Uncle Valera.
- Uncle Valera.

1240
01:32:47,952 --> 01:32:51,683
- Hi, Uncle Valera.
- You know them, and they know you.

1241
01:32:51,792 --> 01:32:53,840
You're not afraid.
Not at all.

1242
01:32:53,992 --> 01:32:55,675
It's your home.

1243
01:32:55,832 --> 01:32:58,244
Your very well-guarded home.

1244
01:32:58,433 --> 01:33:02,039
And so, you park your wheels
in the usual place

1245
01:33:02,153 --> 01:33:05,020
and suddenly you notice
something's wrong.

1246
01:33:05,153 --> 01:33:08,384
- What's wrong?
- The light's on in your window.

1247
01:33:08,513 --> 01:33:12,119
They're usually asleep by now,
but the light's on.

1248
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:14,235
So? Maybe they waited up.

1249
01:33:14,393 --> 01:33:17,260
Of course.
They decided to wait up for you.

1250
01:33:17,393 --> 01:33:20,180
But there's a noise
so you ask Valera.

1251
01:33:20,313 --> 01:33:22,770
"Everything OK?"

1252
01:33:22,912 --> 01:33:24,675
He says: "Yes, it's fine".

1253
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:28,563
You go in.
Auntie Polya, the concierge, smiles.

1254
01:33:28,672 --> 01:33:30,435
Everything's fine.

1255
01:33:30,593 --> 01:33:32,185
Just listen.

1256
01:33:33,952 --> 01:33:36,978
You go to the elevator.
You live on the fifth floor, right?

1257
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:41,367
Right. How did you know?
I really do live on the fifth floor.

1258
01:33:42,433 --> 01:33:44,560
Of course you do.

1259
01:33:44,712 --> 01:33:47,658
It's the best one.
Not too high, not too low.

1260
01:33:47,792 --> 01:33:49,635
And it has a good view.

1261
01:33:49,872 --> 01:33:52,045
But why aren't they asleep?

1262
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:56,573
Why? You'll see the surprise
they've made for you.

1263
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:59,664
Here it is, fifth floor. "Fifth floor".

1264
01:33:59,792 --> 01:34:02,249
It's a woman's voice:
"Fifth floor".

1265
01:34:03,952 --> 01:34:08,002
Oh, those little scamps,
they're not asleep.

1266
01:34:08,112 --> 01:34:10,364
They're waiting for dad.

1267
01:34:10,513 --> 01:34:12,515
They have a surprise for him.

1268
01:34:12,672 --> 01:34:15,618
- I open the door.
- You open the door.

1269
01:34:15,752 --> 01:34:17,140
Wipe your feet.

1270
01:34:18,273 --> 01:34:20,161
Did you wipe them?

1271
01:34:20,353 --> 01:34:22,935
- And it's quiet.
- What's quiet?

1272
01:34:23,072 --> 01:34:27,088
The apartment, very quiet.
It's never been so quiet.

1273
01:34:27,313 --> 01:34:28,871
And the lights.

1274
01:34:29,072 --> 01:34:32,223
Lights are on everywhere.
Things are scattered.

1275
01:34:32,393 --> 01:34:34,691
A child's slipper. Just one.

1276
01:34:34,832 --> 01:34:36,720
A large bath towel.

1277
01:34:36,872 --> 01:34:39,614
On the floor.
You know what's going on.

1278
01:34:39,752 --> 01:34:41,720
You call them.
Please, an answer.

1279
01:34:41,952 --> 01:34:44,978
"Please let them answer".
But they're silent.

1280
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:47,524
The emergency phone
is on the right.

1281
01:34:47,712 --> 01:34:49,714
- On the left.
- Sorry, left.

1282
01:34:49,872 --> 01:34:54,627
The cord's torn out, the receiver's
on the floor. You turn around slowly...

1283
01:34:54,752 --> 01:34:56,800
- And... There it is!
- What?

1284
01:34:56,952 --> 01:34:59,204
There!
Blood under the door.

1285
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:01,930
It opens.
On the chandelier hangs...

1286
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:08,635
A panda.

1287
01:35:09,553 --> 01:35:11,350
A big stuffed panda.

1288
01:35:11,513 --> 01:35:14,334
Your daughter's favorite.
And it's not blood.

1289
01:35:14,473 --> 01:35:16,316
It's a broken wine bottle.

1290
01:35:16,473 --> 01:35:19,294
All is not lost.
You run to the bedroom.

1291
01:35:19,433 --> 01:35:22,994
And here they are!
Your daughter. She looks alive.

1292
01:35:23,153 --> 01:35:25,530
No blood. She was strangled!

1293
01:35:25,672 --> 01:35:29,722
You open the bedroom, and there,
raped and hacked to pieces...

1294
01:35:29,832 --> 01:35:31,720
...is your wife.
It's the end.

1295
01:35:31,872 --> 01:35:34,579
You want to yell, to run,
but you can't.

1296
01:35:34,712 --> 01:35:36,805
You stand like pillar of salt.

1297
01:35:36,992 --> 01:35:38,835
Over their bodies.

1298
01:35:38,992 --> 01:35:41,984
- He's nuts. Nuts.
- Wait. That's not all.

1299
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:44,364
You hear someone behind you.

1300
01:35:44,513 --> 01:35:46,640
Who could it be?

1301
01:35:46,792 --> 01:35:51,502
It's that same Chechen
that you want to save from prison.

1302
01:35:51,633 --> 01:35:53,112
With the same knife.

1303
01:35:53,273 --> 01:35:58,438
He slowly, methodically
pins you belly down to the floor,

1304
01:35:58,672 --> 01:36:00,674
pulls back your head,

1305
01:36:00,832 --> 01:36:05,417
takes that cold, sharp blade
and cuts your throat from ear to ear.

1306
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:14,869
You, Harvard, will crawl
in your own blood.

1307
01:36:15,032 --> 01:36:17,648
With your last breath...

1308
01:36:17,832 --> 01:36:20,778
You don't understand why he did it!

1309
01:36:21,872 --> 01:36:23,305
He did it because we're

1310
01:36:23,513 --> 01:36:25,196
just trophies to them!

1311
01:36:25,353 --> 01:36:27,560
We're not humans, we're trophies!

1312
01:36:34,353 --> 01:36:37,140
I change my vote. The killer is guilty.

1313
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,321
Good for you!

1314
01:36:48,872 --> 01:36:53,457
And good for your mom, too.
What a guy she raised.

1315
01:36:53,553 --> 01:36:56,056
Smart. Lively.

1316
01:36:56,712 --> 01:36:59,499
Imaginative. And truthful.

1317
01:37:06,233 --> 01:37:07,746
There you go.

1318
01:37:09,633 --> 01:37:11,191
Six - six.

1319
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,920
Very interesting.

1320
01:38:08,752 --> 01:38:11,164
Why are you looking at me?

1321
01:38:12,233 --> 01:38:13,951
I don't know...

1322
01:38:14,712 --> 01:38:16,839
He's impressionable.

1323
01:38:18,832 --> 01:38:21,824
He's sick.
Should we call the bailiff?

1324
01:38:21,952 --> 01:38:25,183
- Doctor...
- What can I do?

1325
01:38:25,672 --> 01:38:27,230
It's not...

1326
01:38:27,393 --> 01:38:29,520
...food poisoning...

1327
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:34,579
It's nervous regurgitation.

1328
01:38:35,032 --> 01:38:37,364
Give him some water.

1329
01:39:23,712 --> 01:39:26,738
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. Thanks very much...

1330
01:39:34,072 --> 01:39:35,790
Yes. Yes...

1331
01:39:53,712 --> 01:39:55,839
"The City Wolves".

1332
01:39:55,992 --> 01:39:57,675
Season seven finale.

1333
01:39:57,872 --> 01:40:00,204
That's right. I watched it.

1334
01:40:01,233 --> 01:40:05,329
Every Monday through Thursday at 9:35 pm
You watch our channel.

1335
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:07,025
I'm glad.

1336
01:40:07,233 --> 01:40:08,712
Thank you.

1337
01:40:20,593 --> 01:40:22,072
Don't shoot!

1338
01:40:23,912 --> 01:40:25,630
Everyone back! Back!

1339
01:40:27,752 --> 01:40:29,674
Stay back, I said!

1340
01:40:30,672 --> 01:40:33,948
Don't shoot! Stay where you are!
I said don't shoot!

1341
01:40:35,032 --> 01:40:36,340
Quiet!

1342
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:38,340
Quiet.

1343
01:40:38,712 --> 01:40:40,839
Follow the car!

1344
01:40:42,153 --> 01:40:44,155
Any wounded?

1345
01:40:44,752 --> 01:40:47,698
- No, nobody.
- Good.

1346
01:40:49,393 --> 01:40:50,826
Umar.

1347
01:40:51,112 --> 01:40:52,545
Hey, Umar.

1348
01:40:52,712 --> 01:40:54,270
Is that you?

1349
01:40:54,832 --> 01:40:57,039
It's me, uncle Volodya.

1350
01:40:58,032 --> 01:40:59,750
Calm down. Don't be afraid.

1351
01:41:02,353 --> 01:41:03,741
Get up.

1352
01:41:05,832 --> 01:41:07,754
I'm uncle Volodya.

1353
01:41:10,072 --> 01:41:11,175
Get up.

1354
01:41:11,353 --> 01:41:14,060
Calm down, calm down.

1355
01:41:15,553 --> 01:41:16,781
Umar.

1356
01:41:17,553 --> 01:41:19,271
Umar.

1357
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,680
Calm down.

1358
01:41:25,273 --> 01:41:27,366
Thank God I found you.

1359
01:41:27,872 --> 01:41:31,888
Everything's OK now.
You'll come live with me in Moscow.

1360
01:41:53,633 --> 01:41:55,931
Don't be afraid, it's me.

1361
01:41:56,593 --> 01:41:58,072
Lord...

1362
01:41:59,233 --> 01:42:03,124
You see, we have new lights,
but old wiring.

1363
01:42:03,233 --> 01:42:06,464
It's freezing.
And juries rarely sit this long.

1364
01:42:06,593 --> 01:42:09,994
The wiring can't take it.
I'll give you a lantern.

1365
01:42:10,112 --> 01:42:13,024
Don't worry,
we'll think of something.

1366
01:42:13,153 --> 01:42:14,222
Fine.

1367
01:42:22,912 --> 01:42:25,415
- Here it is.
- What happened?

1368
01:42:25,553 --> 01:42:27,851
I think I understand:
The old man's address!

1369
01:42:28,752 --> 01:42:32,893
When he gave his statement
he gave one address,

1370
01:42:32,992 --> 01:42:35,779
the building where
the murder happened.

1371
01:42:35,912 --> 01:42:40,827
But in court he gave
a different address, his daughter's.

1372
01:42:41,112 --> 01:42:42,875
Yes, he said... Ow!

1373
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:44,181
Sorry.

1374
01:42:44,353 --> 01:42:47,379
He said that
the day after the murder

1375
01:42:47,513 --> 01:42:50,949
he went to his daughter's
on the other side of Moscow.

1376
01:42:51,072 --> 01:42:54,064
And stayed.
So he lives there now?

1377
01:42:54,193 --> 01:42:55,546
That's right.

1378
01:42:55,712 --> 01:42:58,784
He said he went there
for her birthday.

1379
01:42:58,912 --> 01:43:01,005
But the murder

1380
01:43:01,153 --> 01:43:04,384
and his change of address
were in November?

1381
01:43:04,513 --> 01:43:05,696
Yes.

1382
01:43:05,872 --> 01:43:08,284
But the daughter's birthday

1383
01:43:08,952 --> 01:43:10,340
is in March.

1384
01:43:10,553 --> 01:43:13,829
- Some light, please.
- Sure, here you go.

1385
01:43:14,153 --> 01:43:16,565
And what does all this mean?

1386
01:43:16,712 --> 01:43:17,940
Light.

1387
01:43:18,112 --> 01:43:21,343
I'll explain.
I asked our bailiff

1388
01:43:21,473 --> 01:43:25,694
to bring me some information about
the construction next to the building.

1389
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:31,143
It's a huge project,
a luxury apartment building.

1390
01:43:31,553 --> 01:43:34,215
One square meter

1391
01:43:34,353 --> 01:43:37,174
costs at least 4000 dollars.

1392
01:43:37,313 --> 01:43:39,406
All the apartments are sold.

1393
01:43:39,553 --> 01:43:43,774
But the building where the murder happened
stands right where

1394
01:43:43,912 --> 01:43:48,133
they plan to build a wing
of the luxury building.

1395
01:43:48,912 --> 01:43:51,494
The construction schedule is firm.

1396
01:43:51,633 --> 01:43:52,736
And?

1397
01:43:52,912 --> 01:43:56,188
Now imagine you have to
build a building

1398
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:59,259
where people have paid millions
for apartments.

1399
01:43:59,433 --> 01:44:03,529
But two old jerks
who aren't worth a penny

1400
01:44:03,633 --> 01:44:05,601
won't let you start construction.

1401
01:44:05,912 --> 01:44:08,733
It's a public building.
It's central.

1402
01:44:08,912 --> 01:44:12,723
The late officer stayed

1403
01:44:12,872 --> 01:44:16,888
because it had been military housing
but he had no right to stay there.

1404
01:44:17,032 --> 01:44:19,978
But the military didn't have any other
apartment for him.

1405
01:44:20,353 --> 01:44:23,265
And the stubborn old party worker,

1406
01:44:23,593 --> 01:44:26,005
wouldn't leave

1407
01:44:26,153 --> 01:44:30,169
because he demanded an equally good
apartment, and also central.

1408
01:44:30,633 --> 01:44:34,399
In cases like that the job is done
on a personal level.

1409
01:44:34,593 --> 01:44:37,790
They send lawyers, building agents.

1410
01:44:37,912 --> 01:44:40,984
They call themselves
anything they like,

1411
01:44:41,153 --> 01:44:43,565
but really they're just crooks.

1412
01:44:44,233 --> 01:44:48,249
And these thugs go after
the military man

1413
01:44:48,353 --> 01:44:51,140
who fought against them in the war.

1414
01:44:51,273 --> 01:44:53,321
And after the old communist

1415
01:44:53,513 --> 01:44:56,425
who has no idea
what kind of people they are.

1416
01:44:56,593 --> 01:45:00,689
And so they cook up a
lucrative scheme.

1417
01:45:01,553 --> 01:45:03,555
They start surveillance.

1418
01:45:04,433 --> 01:45:06,970
Study the relationships.

1419
01:45:07,112 --> 01:45:09,364
See how they all interact.

1420
01:45:10,032 --> 01:45:12,159
And wait for their moment.

1421
01:45:12,752 --> 01:45:14,140
As a result:

1422
01:45:14,393 --> 01:45:16,520
One person is killed,

1423
01:45:17,112 --> 01:45:19,774
another, who did not kill anyone,

1424
01:45:19,912 --> 01:45:21,960
is sent to prison,

1425
01:45:22,712 --> 01:45:27,342
the third runs off to his daughter's
on the other side of Moscow.

1426
01:45:27,473 --> 01:45:30,465
And within a few days is living there...

1427
01:45:31,752 --> 01:45:33,515
...permanently.

1428
01:45:35,712 --> 01:45:37,100
It was...

1429
01:45:37,712 --> 01:45:40,089
...a very lucrative scheme.

1430
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:41,541
So...

1431
01:45:42,752 --> 01:45:46,233
...you're saying it was a
premeditated murder?

1432
01:45:48,593 --> 01:45:50,276
Looks that way.

1433
01:45:50,473 --> 01:45:52,646
But that's horrible!

1434
01:45:55,553 --> 01:45:56,986
Well...

1435
01:45:57,832 --> 01:46:01,472
...when millions of dollars
are at stake...

1436
01:46:02,752 --> 01:46:06,313
...the difference between persuasion...

1437
01:46:06,672 --> 01:46:08,674
...and execution...

1438
01:46:09,832 --> 01:46:11,390
...disappears.

1439
01:46:11,633 --> 01:46:14,136
How do you know all this?

1440
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:24,613
I say, how do you know all this?

1441
01:46:28,712 --> 01:46:30,509
People talk.

1442
01:46:32,032 --> 01:46:34,330
Pass the candle, please.

1443
01:46:34,633 --> 01:46:35,941
Over here.

1444
01:46:37,832 --> 01:46:42,496
So, you just told us
all of that, and...

1445
01:46:44,712 --> 01:46:46,475
...and what now?

1446
01:46:47,393 --> 01:46:50,135
I'm convinced that the boy

1447
01:46:51,112 --> 01:46:53,524
did not kill his father.

1448
01:46:54,072 --> 01:46:55,380
I vote.

1449
01:46:55,952 --> 01:46:57,260
Not guilty.

1450
01:47:00,072 --> 01:47:01,585
Back to seven -five.

1451
01:47:04,952 --> 01:47:09,332
I'll admit that your wild theory,
so to speak, is possible.

1452
01:47:09,473 --> 01:47:14,058
But you're forgetting the other witness,
in the next building.

1453
01:47:14,153 --> 01:47:18,408
Her windows are across from
the room where the murder happened.

1454
01:47:18,513 --> 01:47:23,018
And she testified that she saw
with her own eyes how the father...

1455
01:47:23,112 --> 01:47:27,003
"The father hit the boy in the face,
and then...

1456
01:47:27,112 --> 01:47:30,388
...the Chechen grabbed a knife
and stuck it...

1457
01:47:30,513 --> 01:47:32,925
...into the chest of the officer, Volodya".

1458
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:37,188
She had no reason to give
false testimony.

1459
01:47:37,313 --> 01:47:40,020
Nobody wanted to tear down her building.

1460
01:47:40,193 --> 01:47:44,243
Don't trust her! That woman
not only claimed she saw the murder.

1461
01:47:44,353 --> 01:47:47,880
She demonstrated
how he stabbed from above.

1462
01:47:47,992 --> 01:47:49,095
Yes?
Yes, she did.

1463
01:47:49,712 --> 01:47:53,933
Before I went to med school
I worked as an orderly.

1464
01:47:54,233 --> 01:47:56,895
I saw lots of knife wounds.

1465
01:47:57,032 --> 01:48:02,720
How could a kid who's
a head shorter than his father.

1466
01:48:02,832 --> 01:48:06,882
How could he stab him
from above?

1467
01:48:06,992 --> 01:48:09,290
What is this, a Bollywood movie?

1468
01:48:09,712 --> 01:48:12,294
It's nonsense.

1469
01:48:14,633 --> 01:48:16,806
It's just ridiculous. Listen...

1470
01:48:17,313 --> 01:48:19,611
...what're you babbling about?

1471
01:48:19,752 --> 01:48:24,132
I don't get it. A "Bollywood movie"?
That's nonsense!

1472
01:48:24,393 --> 01:48:28,284
I've never been an orderly.
Do you want me to show you...

1473
01:48:28,393 --> 01:48:31,999
...how a person can stab someone
a head taller from above?

1474
01:48:34,832 --> 01:48:36,834
Want me to show you?

1475
01:48:37,353 --> 01:48:38,581
Do you?

1476
01:48:41,633 --> 01:48:43,476
Go ahead, if you can...

1477
01:48:43,633 --> 01:48:46,249
- You want me to?
- Go ahead.

1478
01:48:46,752 --> 01:48:48,231
All right.

1479
01:48:48,393 --> 01:48:49,701
Look.

1480
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:55,256
Come here.

1481
01:48:56,273 --> 01:48:57,786
Come here.

1482
01:48:58,193 --> 01:49:00,855
How did he do it? I'll show you.

1483
01:49:01,393 --> 01:49:03,190
Come here. There.

1484
01:49:04,153 --> 01:49:05,381
Where...?

1485
01:49:06,672 --> 01:49:07,980
Come here.

1486
01:49:11,233 --> 01:49:13,645
How'd he do it? Watch.

1487
01:49:14,233 --> 01:49:16,076
Come here. Watch. Watch.

1488
01:49:24,633 --> 01:49:27,249
There. Like that.

1489
01:49:32,513 --> 01:49:33,616
Stop.

1490
01:49:33,792 --> 01:49:35,475
Am I shorter than you?

1491
01:49:35,633 --> 01:49:38,340
Shorter by a head? Well? Am I?

1492
01:49:38,952 --> 01:49:42,183
Shorter, right?
I'm a head shorter than you.

1493
01:49:44,112 --> 01:49:46,160
Bollywood, you say?

1494
01:49:47,313 --> 01:49:49,440
How could he do it?

1495
01:49:52,672 --> 01:49:54,105
I'll show you.

1496
01:49:54,593 --> 01:49:56,925
I'll show you how he could do it.

1497
01:50:03,393 --> 01:50:05,691
His father hit him.

1498
01:50:09,553 --> 01:50:12,056
Insulted him and hit him.
He took the knife.

1499
01:50:13,792 --> 01:50:15,350
I'll kill you!

1500
01:50:27,752 --> 01:50:29,549
What was that?

1501
01:50:30,872 --> 01:50:32,794
Is it blood?

1502
01:50:40,193 --> 01:50:41,501
The bird...

1503
01:50:42,473 --> 01:50:44,191
...pooped.

1504
01:50:46,273 --> 01:50:48,366
Let me have the knife.

1505
01:50:51,153 --> 01:50:52,666
You know?

1506
01:50:53,792 --> 01:50:58,991
The boy grew up in a land where
they know something about knives.

1507
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:06,672
Anyone who's ever used
a knife knows

1508
01:51:07,752 --> 01:51:09,549
you have to strike from below.

1509
01:51:09,752 --> 01:51:13,893
It's always unpredictable.
Always dangerous,

1510
01:51:13,992 --> 01:51:16,574
and always hard to defend against.
Like this.

1511
01:51:17,952 --> 01:51:20,659
What are you...?

1512
01:51:22,513 --> 01:51:24,925
Then, to be sure the knife

1513
01:51:25,153 --> 01:51:29,294
reaches the heart,
as the medical expert said...

1514
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:32,960
...you must strike with power,
penetrate the chest cavity.

1515
01:51:35,912 --> 01:51:37,186
Hey, stop...

1516
01:51:37,433 --> 01:51:39,640
You're a surgeon.

1517
01:51:40,273 --> 01:51:42,480
Yes, a surgeon. Can't you tell?

1518
01:51:43,072 --> 01:51:45,120
A knife...

1519
01:51:45,752 --> 01:51:49,438
...like any other weapon,
especially in the Caucasus,

1520
01:51:49,752 --> 01:51:52,255
is a form of culture.

1521
01:52:27,832 --> 01:52:29,265
Sorry...

1522
01:52:29,633 --> 01:52:32,625
...I learned it when I was a kid,
in the Caucasus.

1523
01:52:33,473 --> 01:52:34,451
Sorry.

1524
01:52:35,273 --> 01:52:37,070
Very interesting.

1525
01:52:42,912 --> 01:52:44,914
I change my decision.

1526
01:52:45,112 --> 01:52:47,160
Oh Lord, I'm blind.

1527
01:53:08,032 --> 01:53:11,593
I can't talk now.
I can't talk now, you hear?

1528
01:53:12,792 --> 01:53:14,919
They're still deliberating.

1529
01:53:15,072 --> 01:53:17,074
Can you imagine?

1530
01:53:17,313 --> 01:53:18,871
All night. Imagine that...

1531
01:53:19,313 --> 01:53:22,055
Got some real go-getters.
Is it my fault?

1532
01:53:23,593 --> 01:53:28,223
Since our wiring is totally shot
this is the best I can do,

1533
01:53:28,513 --> 01:53:30,811
it's left over from a school dance.

1534
01:53:30,952 --> 01:53:34,558
- A karaoke party...
- I'll take the lantern.

1535
01:53:35,273 --> 01:53:37,446
If you did your job,
you'd be home.

1536
01:53:37,593 --> 01:53:41,233
You'd be at a disco or a
karaoke bar like normal people.

1537
01:53:41,353 --> 01:53:43,355
I propose we vote.

1538
01:53:45,193 --> 01:53:49,573
The gentleman builder is right,
it's a very logical plan.

1539
01:53:49,672 --> 01:53:52,129
I think the kid is not guilty.

1540
01:53:52,513 --> 01:53:57,303
Please raise your hand if you
think the accused is guilty.

1541
01:53:59,712 --> 01:54:01,760
One. Two.

1542
01:54:01,952 --> 01:54:03,340
Three.

1543
01:54:05,593 --> 01:54:09,848
Please raise your hand if
you think he is not guilty.

1544
01:54:10,393 --> 01:54:11,746
One, two, three,

1545
01:54:12,112 --> 01:54:15,548
four, five six, seven, eight.

1546
01:54:17,872 --> 01:54:19,760
And you?

1547
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:22,462
Sorry.

1548
01:54:22,672 --> 01:54:24,469
Are you...?
What?

1549
01:54:25,273 --> 01:54:27,685
- How do you vote?
- Meaning?

1550
01:54:28,353 --> 01:54:32,574
You said you change your mind.
What are you changing it to?

1551
01:54:34,473 --> 01:54:35,861
One second.

1552
01:54:37,553 --> 01:54:41,853
Pardon me, but do you recall
how I voted the last time?

1553
01:54:43,233 --> 01:54:46,464
Ah, when you...?
You voted guilty.

1554
01:54:46,872 --> 01:54:48,760
Thank you very much.

1555
01:54:48,952 --> 01:54:52,592
Yes, I definitely change my mind.

1556
01:54:53,633 --> 01:54:57,444
And vote that the accused
is not guilty.

1557
01:54:57,832 --> 01:55:00,949
You won't change again?
I can write...?

1558
01:55:01,112 --> 01:55:04,184
What do you mean?
It's my final decision.

1559
01:55:04,313 --> 01:55:05,905
Based on principle.

1560
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:08,444
Thanks to principles like that

1561
01:55:08,593 --> 01:55:10,595
we'll wake up one day

1562
01:55:11,112 --> 01:55:14,388
surrounded by green berets
restoring order,

1563
01:55:15,193 --> 01:55:17,775
and foreign speech.

1564
01:55:17,992 --> 01:55:21,803
I don't understand why
you're insulting me.

1565
01:55:21,912 --> 01:55:24,984
You changed your mind
just like I did.

1566
01:55:25,153 --> 01:55:27,530
No, pal, not like you did.

1567
01:55:27,672 --> 01:55:31,438
He just described a very clear plan,
and how it works.

1568
01:55:31,553 --> 01:55:33,521
It's one criminal scheme.

1569
01:55:33,672 --> 01:55:36,789
It's not just one.
The scheme is everywhere.

1570
01:55:37,313 --> 01:55:38,792
What scheme?

1571
01:55:39,593 --> 01:55:42,915
When the big fish don't
give a thought to the little people,

1572
01:55:43,792 --> 01:55:47,558
who have to get by
however they can.

1573
01:55:47,952 --> 01:55:49,635
By their own rules.

1574
01:55:50,513 --> 01:55:51,946
It's like that everywhere.

1575
01:55:52,233 --> 01:55:54,645
In construction, in hospitals,

1576
01:55:54,912 --> 01:55:56,300
and in cemeteries.

1577
01:55:56,513 --> 01:55:58,890
What do cemeteries
have to do with it?

1578
01:56:00,233 --> 01:56:02,406
Have you ever buried anyone?

1579
01:56:03,032 --> 01:56:04,306
Me?

1580
01:56:05,672 --> 01:56:07,230
Yes, I have.

1581
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:13,593
Two years ago.
In London. Matilda.

1582
01:56:13,752 --> 01:56:15,026
Who was she?

1583
01:56:17,353 --> 01:56:18,991
A Rottweiler.

1584
01:56:19,513 --> 01:56:22,459
That's not a name.
It's a breed of dog.

1585
01:56:23,153 --> 01:56:26,020
I don't know how they bury dogs
in London,

1586
01:56:26,153 --> 01:56:29,475
but I do know how we see people off
on their final journey.

1587
01:56:29,633 --> 01:56:34,184
I've been a cemetery director for 8 years.
Now, imagine this.

1588
01:56:34,273 --> 01:56:38,573
You're burying a loved one.
A funeral service, the usual.

1589
01:56:38,672 --> 01:56:40,640
You go to the graveyard.

1590
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:43,448
- Like this.
- What are you...? What grave?

1591
01:56:43,633 --> 01:56:45,316
- That's mom.
- Sorry.

1592
01:56:45,513 --> 01:56:47,310
My mom's there.

1593
01:56:47,513 --> 01:56:49,890
- Well, it's...
- My mom.

1594
01:56:50,553 --> 01:56:53,090
The final farewell, relatives.

1595
01:56:53,273 --> 01:56:56,504
And some old lady standing nearby.

1596
01:56:56,672 --> 01:56:59,414
She looks into the grave
and says "Oh God, that poor man".

1597
01:56:59,593 --> 01:57:03,324
They say "What is it?"
They look, the grave's flooded.

1598
01:57:03,672 --> 01:57:05,151
How can that be?

1599
01:57:05,313 --> 01:57:09,534
What can they do? You can't
put your loved one in a swamp.

1600
01:57:09,792 --> 01:57:11,919
And the old granny whispers advice.

1601
01:57:12,393 --> 01:57:15,999
They go to the head gravedigger,
who's there.

1602
01:57:16,712 --> 01:57:20,443
They say: "Sir, there's water in there.
Please do something".

1603
01:57:20,952 --> 01:57:24,638
He gives them some line
about ground water

1604
01:57:24,752 --> 01:57:27,255
and he shovels the liquid
out of the grave.

1605
01:57:27,393 --> 01:57:29,850
But it runs back in. They're in shock.

1606
01:57:29,992 --> 01:57:34,827
The old lady tugs at someone's sleeve
and shows them another grave nearby,

1607
01:57:35,193 --> 01:57:37,525
that's completely dry.

1608
01:57:37,712 --> 01:57:39,191
And pristine.

1609
01:57:39,553 --> 01:57:41,965
Now here's the interesting part.

1610
01:57:42,233 --> 01:57:45,259
The relatives ask the digger,

1611
01:57:45,393 --> 01:57:48,590
"Listen is there any way
we can change places?"

1612
01:57:48,992 --> 01:57:50,550
"Are you crazy?"

1613
01:57:51,273 --> 01:57:54,504
They're burying someone there
in 15 minutes.

1614
01:57:54,633 --> 01:57:57,249
No way. All the paperwork's done"

1615
01:57:57,712 --> 01:58:03,196
They get on their knees, in tears;,
"Sir, please help us. We'll pay.

1616
01:58:03,273 --> 01:58:04,911
Just tell us how much".

1617
01:58:05,112 --> 01:58:08,388
The rest is easy.
He looks at their clothes.

1618
01:58:08,513 --> 01:58:11,016
For you, 2000 bucks.

1619
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:15,808
For someone else, 500. If they're poor
he won't even look at them.

1620
01:58:16,752 --> 01:58:21,212
They swap stones.
The dead guy gets a dry grave

1621
01:58:21,313 --> 01:58:25,329
The family leaves.
The old lady gets 500 rubles

1622
01:58:25,832 --> 01:58:29,518
They pull out the plastic sheet from
under the grave

1623
01:58:29,912 --> 01:58:32,528
and in 15 minutes it's dry.

1624
01:58:33,752 --> 01:58:37,848
And the diggers are ready
to rig up another wet grave.

1625
01:58:39,032 --> 01:58:40,875
That's it.

1626
01:58:51,393 --> 01:58:54,465
I'm glad we cremated
my mother in law.

1627
01:58:58,752 --> 01:59:00,925
Very interesting.

1628
01:59:06,513 --> 01:59:09,380
Why are you looking at me?

1629
01:59:11,513 --> 01:59:14,334
Is it different where you work?

1630
01:59:16,792 --> 01:59:19,659
Everyone's in on it. Everyone.

1631
01:59:20,233 --> 01:59:22,440
In their own way.

1632
01:59:22,832 --> 01:59:24,220
Right, friend?

1633
01:59:27,792 --> 01:59:29,271
Rolex?

1634
01:59:29,672 --> 01:59:31,185
Yeah.

1635
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:33,515
Expensive.

1636
01:59:35,792 --> 01:59:36,770
Well, yeah.

1637
01:59:36,952 --> 01:59:38,670
On your cemetery pay?

1638
01:59:41,672 --> 01:59:43,060
Yes...

1639
01:59:44,792 --> 01:59:47,943
...on my cemetery pay. I won't lie

1640
01:59:49,233 --> 01:59:51,940
But I also used that cemetery pay

1641
01:59:52,072 --> 01:59:54,575
to restore the chapel.

1642
01:59:54,712 --> 01:59:58,273
And I feed the bums who
hang around the cemetery.

1643
01:59:58,393 --> 02:00:00,850
They have to eat somewhere.

1644
02:00:01,672 --> 02:00:06,097
And I built a school in the town
where I was born, 830 km from Moscow.

1645
02:00:08,032 --> 02:00:10,614
It has a gym... come visit,
you'll see.

1646
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:14,279
And we don't have monstrosities,
like that pipe.

1647
02:00:14,393 --> 02:00:17,180
My pipes are underground,
where they should be.

1648
02:00:17,353 --> 02:00:21,813
There's a computer lab with
LCD screens.

1649
02:00:21,952 --> 02:00:25,797
Local teachers, all with
good salaries.

1650
02:00:26,872 --> 02:00:30,069
We have a bus to bring kids
from farther away.

1651
02:00:30,193 --> 02:00:32,320
And take them home, of course.

1652
02:00:32,473 --> 02:00:35,590
So they don't have time
to sniff glue.

1653
02:00:37,433 --> 02:00:40,914
And if you ask
the people in the village:

1654
02:00:41,672 --> 02:00:45,813
"Where'd the money to build this
school come from?"

1655
02:00:48,672 --> 02:00:53,018
They couldn't care less where
the money came from,

1656
02:00:53,992 --> 02:00:56,904
as long as the school stays
up and running.

1657
02:00:57,032 --> 02:01:00,798
So I use money from the dead
to help the living.

1658
02:01:01,233 --> 02:01:03,815
Since nobody else is going to.

1659
02:01:12,712 --> 02:01:15,624
In short, the Chechen is not guilty.

1660
02:01:18,313 --> 02:01:20,565
Still, can you explain to me,

1661
02:01:20,712 --> 02:01:25,012
an almost sane person,
why that simple woman,

1662
02:01:25,112 --> 02:01:27,000
who is not part of any scheme,

1663
02:01:27,153 --> 02:01:30,065
testified in court
that the Chechen

1664
02:01:30,193 --> 02:01:32,900
killed the Russian officer
Volodya with a knife?

1665
02:01:33,072 --> 02:01:35,040
I know why.

1666
02:01:35,633 --> 02:01:39,399
You can yell at me.
You can laugh. But I know.

1667
02:01:39,752 --> 02:01:42,368
- It was jealousy.
- What?

1668
02:01:44,433 --> 02:01:46,355
Jealousy,

1669
02:01:46,872 --> 02:01:50,683
She didn't hear the boy,
she lives across the street.

1670
02:01:50,792 --> 02:01:54,762
She didn't see anything either
because it was night time.

1671
02:01:54,872 --> 02:01:58,968
At best, she saw some shadows,
though I doubt it.

1672
02:01:59,072 --> 02:02:00,790
She didn't see anything.

1673
02:02:00,952 --> 02:02:03,898
She was convinced that it was the boy
and no one else,

1674
02:02:04,032 --> 02:02:06,853
because she wanted
and was prepared to see

1675
02:02:06,992 --> 02:02:09,904
the worst in him.

1676
02:02:10,032 --> 02:02:11,385
Why?

1677
02:02:12,832 --> 02:02:14,265
Jealousy.

1678
02:02:14,433 --> 02:02:15,946
Terrible,

1679
02:02:16,353 --> 02:02:18,036
senseless, female jealousy.

1680
02:02:18,553 --> 02:02:20,066
Look at these photos.

1681
02:02:20,273 --> 02:02:22,480
She showed them in court.

1682
02:02:23,513 --> 02:02:26,459
To prove that she knew the victim.

1683
02:02:27,032 --> 02:02:29,774
Here's a photo of them at a party.

1684
02:02:29,912 --> 02:02:32,085
Her, the deceased, and his wife.

1685
02:02:32,233 --> 02:02:33,871
Now here's one...

1686
02:02:36,353 --> 02:02:39,265
...of her, him, and someone's arm.

1687
02:02:39,513 --> 02:02:41,435
It's his wife's arm.

1688
02:02:41,672 --> 02:02:45,768
Why did she need to go
and crop the photo

1689
02:02:45,872 --> 02:02:47,760
so it only shows her
and the deceased?

1690
02:02:48,032 --> 02:02:50,159
Cutting out the wife.

1691
02:02:51,473 --> 02:02:54,260
This is a photo of her dream.

1692
02:02:54,553 --> 02:02:57,784
What happens next is very simple:

1693
02:02:57,912 --> 02:02:59,220
A single woman,

1694
02:02:59,433 --> 02:03:04,188
childless, who dreams of finally
having her own family.

1695
02:03:04,313 --> 02:03:07,999
She likes the man from across the street,
but he's married.

1696
02:03:08,193 --> 02:03:12,289
She writes him in Chechnya,
tells him his wife's cheating.

1697
02:03:12,393 --> 02:03:14,315
- Can I see?
- Sure, here.

1698
02:03:14,473 --> 02:03:18,239
And that she's sorry,
but she couldn't keep quiet.

1699
02:03:18,353 --> 02:03:21,880
True or not,
she did write him the letter.

1700
02:03:22,433 --> 02:03:24,116
It was jealousy.

1701
02:03:24,273 --> 02:03:27,345
She engineered his divorce.

1702
02:03:27,473 --> 02:03:28,952
That was it!

1703
02:03:29,112 --> 02:03:32,957
No more obstacles.
Just her and him, like the photo.

1704
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:35,779
All she had to do was
wait for his return.

1705
02:03:35,952 --> 02:03:38,489
The return of her beloved.

1706
02:03:39,032 --> 02:03:41,535
And he arrives, but not alone.

1707
02:03:41,672 --> 02:03:45,073
He's with a nasty, filthy
savage monkey

1708
02:03:45,193 --> 02:03:47,400
who can hardly speak Russian.

1709
02:03:47,593 --> 02:03:52,508
Remember, she said she asked him
what his plans were?

1710
02:03:53,233 --> 02:03:54,951
And he just replied

1711
02:03:55,112 --> 02:03:59,048
that he planned to live with the kid
and take care of him.

1712
02:03:59,153 --> 02:04:01,895
That was it. All her hopes, ruined.

1713
02:04:02,112 --> 02:04:04,034
But she kept it up.

1714
02:04:04,193 --> 02:04:07,469
Remember, she said she invited him over.

1715
02:04:07,593 --> 02:04:09,356
With the boy. For her birthday.

1716
02:04:09,513 --> 02:04:13,279
She made dinner, bought sweets,
and a book.

1717
02:04:14,072 --> 02:04:17,144
Later she discovered
that some money was missing

1718
02:04:17,273 --> 02:04:21,164
from next to where
that poor boy was sitting.

1719
02:04:22,072 --> 02:04:25,018
And she tried to convince him
to return it.

1720
02:04:26,032 --> 02:04:29,229
Eventually she admitted in court
that she had put it somewhere else

1721
02:04:29,633 --> 02:04:32,955
and forgot.

1722
02:04:33,792 --> 02:04:36,534
But, at the time, she mentions
the money

1723
02:04:36,672 --> 02:04:40,028
in front of a combat vet
who'd been wounded.

1724
02:04:40,153 --> 02:04:43,225
She must have known
what could happen.

1725
02:04:43,353 --> 02:04:45,321
And did happen, of course.

1726
02:04:45,473 --> 02:04:49,614
The man hears that the kid
he considers his son is a thief.

1727
02:04:50,273 --> 02:04:52,241
And he loses control of himself.

1728
02:04:52,832 --> 02:04:55,130
He smacks the boy, but she's silent.

1729
02:04:55,313 --> 02:04:58,544
And when his nose bleeds

1730
02:04:58,672 --> 02:05:01,698
she leaps to his defense
and says the boy's innocent.

1731
02:05:01,832 --> 02:05:04,824
Or rather, he's guilty,
but shouldn't be hit.

1732
02:05:04,952 --> 02:05:08,353
Because children are weaker,
you shouldn't hurt them.

1733
02:05:13,553 --> 02:05:15,066
God!

1734
02:05:16,992 --> 02:05:18,755
She didn't lie.

1735
02:05:18,912 --> 02:05:21,449
She wanted to believe

1736
02:05:21,912 --> 02:05:24,904
the murderer was the boy

1737
02:05:25,832 --> 02:05:27,800
and no one else.

1738
02:05:29,593 --> 02:05:30,981
Jealousy.

1739
02:05:32,712 --> 02:05:34,714
Senseless, cruel,

1740
02:05:35,672 --> 02:05:38,493
blind, instinctive

1741
02:05:39,952 --> 02:05:41,954
female jealousy.

1742
02:05:45,273 --> 02:05:46,911
That's it.

1743
02:05:48,072 --> 02:05:49,585
Right there.

1744
02:05:50,233 --> 02:05:53,100
She found the money later,
she said so herself.

1745
02:05:57,672 --> 02:05:59,230
I live with my son.

1746
02:05:59,393 --> 02:06:03,033
He's twenty now, but back then, in"91
he was six.

1747
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:07,308
In 1990 my wife left me.

1748
02:06:09,273 --> 02:06:12,709
She ran off with a guy from the States.
The hell with her...

1749
02:06:13,112 --> 02:06:17,492
The kid was upset, of course,
but I explained that mom just went

1750
02:06:18,513 --> 02:06:21,505
on a long trip, and that
he'd see her again.

1751
02:06:21,633 --> 02:06:24,340
My mom looked after him.

1752
02:06:24,912 --> 02:06:28,439
I had started driving a cab,
working like a dog.

1753
02:06:31,072 --> 02:06:33,779
Didn't really think about my family.

1754
02:06:34,112 --> 02:06:36,774
Women are no problem for a cabbie.

1755
02:06:36,912 --> 02:06:38,391
One day...

1756
02:06:38,992 --> 02:06:42,678
...I started talking to this woman.
Not a beauty

1757
02:06:43,032 --> 02:06:47,082
We went out a couple of times,
and she came to live with us.

1758
02:06:48,633 --> 02:06:52,399
I didn't need much from her:

1759
02:06:52,513 --> 02:06:55,789
Meals, laundry, take the kid to school.
She seemed to like him just fine.

1760
02:06:56,912 --> 02:06:58,755
Kolya. Little Nikolai.

1761
02:07:01,712 --> 02:07:05,239
For the life of me, I can't remember
how it started.

1762
02:07:10,792 --> 02:07:14,148
She began to tell me things
about my boy...

1763
02:07:14,553 --> 02:07:18,114
...that he was lazy,
that he misbehaved.

1764
02:07:18,233 --> 02:07:21,179
I call him over and ask:
"Is it true?"

1765
02:07:21,313 --> 02:07:26,592
He looks at me, smiling,
and says: "Yes, dad." And hides his eyes.

1766
02:07:27,313 --> 02:07:29,315
I punished him.

1767
02:07:32,072 --> 02:07:37,066
One day I'd had enough,
I don't remember what she told me

1768
02:07:37,153 --> 02:07:40,384
but I just snapped.

1769
02:07:40,513 --> 02:07:42,686
I busted into his room

1770
02:07:42,832 --> 02:07:45,778
dragged him out of bed,
punched him.

1771
02:07:45,912 --> 02:07:49,143
She's quiet.
Then her nose starts bleeding.

1772
02:07:49,273 --> 02:07:51,116
She screams.

1773
02:07:51,273 --> 02:07:55,824
"Murderer! Murderer! What are you doing?!
You're killing the child!"

1774
02:07:56,593 --> 02:07:58,481
And it started.

1775
02:07:59,112 --> 02:08:00,955
I'd beat him...

1776
02:08:02,433 --> 02:08:05,140
She'd see the blood and scream.

1777
02:08:05,273 --> 02:08:07,650
It was brutal.

1778
02:08:08,712 --> 02:08:13,627
And my boy, it was as if
he was expecting it.

1779
02:08:13,712 --> 02:08:16,909
He stopped crying.
He'd just blink and smile,

1780
02:08:17,032 --> 02:08:19,489
blink over and over, but not cry.
He didn't cry.

1781
02:08:19,633 --> 02:08:23,478
I punch him.
His face is bloody.

1782
02:08:23,593 --> 02:08:26,505
And he keeps blinking and smiling.

1783
02:08:27,792 --> 02:08:30,044
Blinking and smiling.

1784
02:08:34,273 --> 02:08:36,321
One night I woke up.

1785
02:08:39,832 --> 02:08:42,084
I heard water running.

1786
02:08:42,553 --> 02:08:45,374
I go to the bathroom,
he's washing his sheet

1787
02:08:45,513 --> 02:08:48,095
He had pissed his bed.

1788
02:08:48,633 --> 02:08:50,021
That kid...

1789
02:08:50,473 --> 02:08:53,260
He sat in the corner
hugging the sheet.

1790
02:08:53,393 --> 02:08:56,214
Looking at me and smiling.
Smiling.

1791
02:08:56,353 --> 02:08:59,060
Blinking and smiling.

1792
02:09:02,072 --> 02:09:04,688
It was like he was always guilty.

1793
02:09:04,832 --> 02:09:07,824
That look, and that smile.
He'd look at me...

1794
02:09:07,952 --> 02:09:10,250
And I was right in a way,

1795
02:09:10,393 --> 02:09:12,850
But in my soul, deep down...

1796
02:09:14,633 --> 02:09:18,649
It was like someone made me
my own son's executioner.

1797
02:09:19,233 --> 02:09:21,645
Then she had a baby, also a boy.

1798
02:09:21,792 --> 02:09:25,762
He was about four.
He acted up in front of me.

1799
02:09:25,872 --> 02:09:28,079
I gave him a little smack.

1800
02:09:28,233 --> 02:09:31,760
And bam!
God help me...

1801
02:09:32,233 --> 02:09:35,873
I barely got away. She threw an iron,
it just missed me.

1802
02:09:40,233 --> 02:09:42,326
I could slug my own son,

1803
02:09:42,473 --> 02:09:46,819
but I just barely touched hers,
and she nearly killed me.

1804
02:09:50,912 --> 02:09:55,133
She and the kid went to
her relatives in Tambov.

1805
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:01,965
I was working nights.

1806
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:05,798
I had already left the building
when I turned around.

1807
02:10:05,912 --> 02:10:09,643
It was like someone grabbed me
by the collar.

1808
02:10:09,752 --> 02:10:13,802
I saw a light in the window.
I ran to the apartment.

1809
02:10:14,072 --> 02:10:16,404
I look all over, can't find him.
It's 3am.

1810
02:10:16,553 --> 02:10:18,805
I hear a rustling in the closet.

1811
02:10:18,952 --> 02:10:20,635
I open the closet.

1812
02:10:21,433 --> 02:10:25,813
And he's sitting there.
Smiling and looking at me.

1813
02:10:26,393 --> 02:10:29,510
And blinking.
Blinking, over and over.

1814
02:10:30,112 --> 02:10:34,162
I say: "Son, what are you doing?"
I pull him out of the closet.

1815
02:10:34,273 --> 02:10:36,446
I hold him. He holds me tight.

1816
02:10:36,593 --> 02:10:41,303
He looks at me, smiling and blinking,
and he's got something behind his back.

1817
02:10:41,712 --> 02:10:44,658
I say: "Son, what's that?"

1818
02:10:44,792 --> 02:10:48,478
And I take his hand.
Like that. His hand.

1819
02:10:54,593 --> 02:10:57,414
And he's holding a noose.

1820
02:11:00,233 --> 02:11:02,975
A noose he made from my belt.

1821
02:11:10,072 --> 02:11:12,165
I don't know...

1822
02:11:12,872 --> 02:11:15,045
...what he saw on my face.

1823
02:11:15,193 --> 02:11:18,720
But he grabbed me, hugged me,
pressed himself tight.

1824
02:11:19,992 --> 02:11:23,723
And whispered:
"Papa, don't, papa".

1825
02:11:24,672 --> 02:11:27,948
"Papa, don't, don't".
Over and over.

1826
02:11:28,072 --> 02:11:31,348
"Don't, papa, don't".
And he's smiling.

1827
02:11:31,792 --> 02:11:34,864
Smiling and saying: "Papa, don't".

1828
02:11:59,473 --> 02:12:01,191
Well...

1829
02:12:01,353 --> 02:12:02,911
...I vote...

1830
02:12:03,872 --> 02:12:05,715
...the kid is not guilty.

1831
02:12:06,353 --> 02:12:07,991
Write it down.

1832
02:12:08,153 --> 02:12:09,131
Yes, you know,

1833
02:12:09,353 --> 02:12:13,119
that was very persuasive.

1834
02:12:14,112 --> 02:12:16,615
I agree, the boy is not guilty.

1835
02:12:16,792 --> 02:12:18,840
- Let's vote.
- OK, fine.

1836
02:12:18,992 --> 02:12:21,779
Who thinks he is not guilty,
raise your hand.

1837
02:12:25,433 --> 02:12:28,630
- Thank God.
- Finally, thank you.

1838
02:12:29,273 --> 02:12:31,810
It's unanimous, he's not guilty.

1839
02:12:31,952 --> 02:12:34,125
Wait. Let's write it down.

1840
02:12:36,153 --> 02:12:38,690
Wait, please. Wait.

1841
02:12:39,193 --> 02:12:41,809
Just wait.

1842
02:12:42,752 --> 02:12:44,754
I haven't voted yet.

1843
02:12:44,912 --> 02:12:47,858
- Well, I hope you'll join us.
- No.

1844
02:12:50,633 --> 02:12:52,351
I think

1845
02:12:52,752 --> 02:12:54,845
he's guilty.

1846
02:12:56,353 --> 02:12:59,425
Eleven for "not guilty"
and one for "guilty".

1847
02:12:59,912 --> 02:13:03,643
- Listen!
- I'll explain, I'll explain.

1848
02:13:03,752 --> 02:13:05,959
- These artists...
- Why?

1849
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:10,499
- Come on...
- I don't get it.

1850
02:13:10,633 --> 02:13:13,340
We only hurt the ones we love...

1851
02:13:19,032 --> 02:13:21,409
I knew from the first minute

1852
02:13:21,553 --> 02:13:23,555
that he was innocent.

1853
02:13:25,273 --> 02:13:27,161
Professional experience.

1854
02:13:27,313 --> 02:13:31,158
I agree with all the explanations
we've come up with here.

1855
02:13:31,273 --> 02:13:33,935
The old man was obviously scared.

1856
02:13:34,313 --> 02:13:37,385
And the woman...
You forgot that she's nearsighted.

1857
02:13:37,513 --> 02:13:41,404
She wears glasses. And she claimed
she was sleeping that night.

1858
02:13:41,513 --> 02:13:44,949
She had to put on her glasses
and go to the window.

1859
02:13:45,072 --> 02:13:46,960
It's not realistic.

1860
02:13:47,112 --> 02:13:51,537
And the boy, well, he's from the Caucasus.
They're very different people.

1861
02:13:52,032 --> 02:13:56,412
I worked there a few times,
I know them.

1862
02:13:56,513 --> 02:13:59,129
He wouldn't yell "I'll kill you!",
he'd just kill you.

1863
02:13:59,273 --> 02:14:03,858
And he wouldn't make up
a stupid story.

1864
02:14:04,952 --> 02:14:08,843
The rest is obvious.
It was clearly a set up.

1865
02:14:09,473 --> 02:14:11,111
Arranged by people

1866
02:14:11,313 --> 02:14:15,204
who really need the kid
to go to prison. Right?

1867
02:14:15,313 --> 02:14:17,850
We saw that. We proved that
he's innocent.

1868
02:14:18,032 --> 02:14:19,260
Right?

1869
02:14:19,473 --> 02:14:21,191
But as soon as

1870
02:14:23,353 --> 02:14:26,959
we reach that verdict,
they'll let him go.

1871
02:14:27,112 --> 02:14:28,909
Of course they will. And?

1872
02:14:29,112 --> 02:14:31,285
- That's great.
- And thank God.

1873
02:14:32,193 --> 02:14:34,650
Yes, thank God he's not a murderer.

1874
02:14:34,832 --> 02:14:39,952
Then what? Why did you
vote to find him guilty?

1875
02:14:40,273 --> 02:14:42,480
I don't understand at all.

1876
02:14:42,633 --> 02:14:46,569
I have ceased to understand anything.
We finally... You...

1877
02:14:47,072 --> 02:14:48,915
I just don't understand anymore.

1878
02:14:49,072 --> 02:14:51,779
After all we've gone through.
Me, for instance

1879
02:14:51,952 --> 02:14:54,000
And when... I'm sorry.
When we all...

1880
02:14:54,193 --> 02:14:56,491
And you... What is this?

1881
02:14:56,672 --> 02:15:00,312
We've accomplished a great thing,
an arduous task.

1882
02:15:00,433 --> 02:15:02,321
We've established the truth.

1883
02:15:02,513 --> 02:15:04,515
I can say one thing for sure.

1884
02:15:04,672 --> 02:15:09,097
He'll live longer in prison,
than he will on the street.

1885
02:15:09,193 --> 02:15:10,956
Very interesting.

1886
02:15:11,193 --> 02:15:15,414
If he gets out now, he won't go to
a bar or home, or to relatives.

1887
02:15:15,952 --> 02:15:18,694
He has nothing, nobody, understand?

1888
02:15:18,872 --> 02:15:21,204
He'll look for the killers.

1889
02:15:21,353 --> 02:15:24,789
Also, if we acquit him now,

1890
02:15:24,912 --> 02:15:29,906
it will automatically trigger
an investigation into the unsolved murder.

1891
02:15:29,992 --> 02:15:33,018
The men who killed his father

1892
02:15:33,433 --> 02:15:36,345
will be on guard,
and they'll look for the kid.

1893
02:15:36,513 --> 02:15:38,310
He'll look for them.

1894
02:15:38,513 --> 02:15:42,563
And they'll look for him,
but he doesn't know where they are.

1895
02:15:42,712 --> 02:15:45,124
But they know where he is.

1896
02:15:45,273 --> 02:15:50,233
So our decision, instead of sending
the kid to prison

1897
02:15:50,313 --> 02:15:52,850
will be his death warrant.

1898
02:15:52,992 --> 02:15:56,393
And they'll kill him crudely, horribly.

1899
02:15:56,832 --> 02:15:59,904
Like a dog, with a sharpened screwdriver...

1900
02:16:00,032 --> 02:16:03,388
And nobody will look for him.
You know that.

1901
02:16:03,513 --> 02:16:08,473
They'll find him 8 or 10 months later
in a sewer or a garbage dump.

1902
02:16:08,553 --> 02:16:09,781
And that's it.

1903
02:16:09,992 --> 02:16:13,678
There are people in the courtroom

1904
02:16:13,792 --> 02:16:17,228
following every step of the trial.

1905
02:16:17,752 --> 02:16:21,893
I can smell it.
Professional instinct.

1906
02:16:22,072 --> 02:16:23,300
Understand?

1907
02:16:23,513 --> 02:16:25,356
- An artist's instinct
- What?

1908
02:16:25,553 --> 02:16:27,191
An artist's.

1909
02:16:27,912 --> 02:16:29,015
Yes, an artist's.

1910
02:16:29,353 --> 02:16:32,220
What if he hangs himself in prison?

1911
02:16:34,352 --> 02:16:37,264
How do we know what'll
happen to him in there?

1912
02:16:37,553 --> 02:16:39,680
How will he act?
How can we know?

1913
02:16:44,313 --> 02:16:46,816
Well, then, that's his fate...

1914
02:16:48,913 --> 02:16:51,165
...if he hangs himself.

1915
02:16:51,993 --> 02:16:54,325
But I'll tell you one thing for sure.

1916
02:16:54,473 --> 02:16:58,773
He'll live longer
in prison than he will on the street.

1917
02:16:58,993 --> 02:17:03,043
OK, then what do you suggest?

1918
02:17:03,712 --> 02:17:06,909
Are you proposing we let
an innocent man sit in prison

1919
02:17:07,073 --> 02:17:08,711
while the criminals go free?

1920
02:17:08,913 --> 02:17:11,325
- Exactly.
- I didn't propose that.

1921
02:17:11,553 --> 02:17:15,933
Hide him away in prison:
He has nowhere else to go, anyway.

1922
02:17:16,393 --> 02:17:19,920
His home was torn down.
He has nowhere to live.

1923
02:17:19,993 --> 02:17:23,679
We'll hire lawyers.
We can get some money together.

1924
02:17:23,792 --> 02:17:26,818
We'll go to the prosecutor.
We'll find professionals.

1925
02:17:26,913 --> 02:17:31,543
And tell them what we know.
They'll nail the killers to the wall.

1926
02:17:31,633 --> 02:17:35,603
Then, when they're locked up,
the kid can be let out.

1927
02:17:35,712 --> 02:17:38,328
And then he'll be free and safe.
From them, anyway.

1928
02:17:38,553 --> 02:17:41,579
You'll excuse me, but, these lawyers,

1929
02:17:41,712 --> 02:17:45,523
these professional people,
that prosecutor...

1930
02:17:45,633 --> 02:17:48,830
Who's going to handle all of that?
I'm curious.

1931
02:17:51,073 --> 02:17:53,325
Who? What do you mean, who?

1932
02:17:53,473 --> 02:17:54,451
Who?

1933
02:17:54,633 --> 02:17:56,396
We will. Who else?

1934
02:17:57,473 --> 02:17:58,622
Us?

1935
02:17:59,153 --> 02:18:01,895
Who else has any use

1936
02:18:02,233 --> 02:18:06,044
for a poor Chechen boy who
doesn't speak Russian

1937
02:18:06,872 --> 02:18:09,249
and was accused of killing his father?

1938
02:18:09,393 --> 02:18:13,443
Who's going to handle it?
Who needs him more than we do? Who?

1939
02:18:32,073 --> 02:18:36,373
I'm a cab driver. Not an investigator.
I gotta work.

1940
02:18:37,233 --> 02:18:39,645
I understand, of course, but...

1941
02:18:41,553 --> 02:18:43,066
...I don't know.

1942
02:18:45,233 --> 02:18:49,943
I don't know, I used to have contacts
in the prosecutor's office.

1943
02:18:49,993 --> 02:18:53,929
But that was 100 years ago,
when dad was alive.

1944
02:18:54,393 --> 02:18:57,260
And I'm supposed to go
to Japan for six months.

1945
02:18:57,393 --> 02:19:01,033
It's a complicated project.
It's not just me, understand.

1946
02:19:01,153 --> 02:19:04,099
I have 850 employees to think about.

1947
02:19:04,233 --> 02:19:07,509
What do you think?
That I'm going to work there,

1948
02:19:07,633 --> 02:19:11,979
while there's an innocent man
in prison who can't do anything?

1949
02:19:16,473 --> 02:19:18,725
The 21st, 22nd...

1950
02:19:18,872 --> 02:19:21,079
...and the 20, yes.

1951
02:19:21,233 --> 02:19:25,374
I for example have four operations
scheduled next week.

1952
02:19:25,792 --> 02:19:29,762
On the 21st, the 23rd,
and two on the 24th.

1953
02:19:29,872 --> 02:19:33,603
Should I cancel them all?
How can I?

1954
02:19:33,792 --> 02:19:37,273
OK, gentlemen.

1955
02:19:37,473 --> 02:19:40,590
Let's say, purely hypothetically,

1956
02:19:40,712 --> 02:19:43,579
that, say I could do it, but how?

1957
02:19:43,712 --> 02:19:46,169
It's a very serious job. I'd need...

1958
02:19:46,313 --> 02:19:50,363
I'd need a ton of time.
I'm producing a new reality show.

1959
02:19:50,473 --> 02:19:52,065
I'm working day and night.

1960
02:19:52,313 --> 02:19:54,929
The show's called "Planet Good."
It's...

1961
02:19:56,633 --> 02:19:59,500
OK, it's clear that we'd
all do it, but when?

1962
02:20:00,473 --> 02:20:04,284
A 3-month tour.
I'm already late, I'll have to catch up.

1963
02:20:04,393 --> 02:20:07,510
Listen, my dear, kind friends.

1964
02:20:07,633 --> 02:20:12,138
We've done a great thing.
We've liberated an innocent person.

1965
02:20:12,233 --> 02:20:14,815
One who's a stranger to us,
by the way.

1966
02:20:14,913 --> 02:20:16,801
We've fulfilled our duty as jurors.

1967
02:20:16,993 --> 02:20:19,814
The rest is up to other official organs.

1968
02:20:19,993 --> 02:20:22,655
Don't start an amateur investigation.

1969
02:20:22,792 --> 02:20:25,579
There are, after all, laws!

1970
02:20:25,712 --> 02:20:29,762
What is it? Have you all lost it?
Brave young pioneers.

1971
02:20:29,993 --> 02:20:34,214
You want to stick around till morning?
Come to your senses!

1972
02:20:34,313 --> 02:20:38,283
I have to be at the airport
in an hour and forty minutes.

1973
02:20:38,393 --> 02:20:41,749
My girlfriend's flying in from Dubai,
Julie.

1974
02:20:41,913 --> 02:20:45,519
She's 21. It's been 2 months.
Are you trying to ruin my life?

1975
02:20:45,633 --> 02:20:47,635
Are you out of your minds?

1976
02:20:47,792 --> 02:20:50,943
I started to work out
like an old fool.

1977
02:20:51,153 --> 02:20:53,405
She has tits like melons.

1978
02:20:53,553 --> 02:20:57,603
I haven't seen her for 2 months.
I'm in love, for the first time.

1979
02:20:57,792 --> 02:20:59,714
Six feet one.

1980
02:20:59,872 --> 02:21:01,874
Chocolate brown nipples. Like this.

1981
02:21:02,792 --> 02:21:05,329
Lips like Angelina Jolie. Green eyes...

1982
02:21:06,633 --> 02:21:11,058
Don't get me started on her ass,
I've gone on long enough.

1983
02:21:11,393 --> 02:21:15,033
They laugh at me at the cemetery.
I write poetry at work.

1984
02:21:15,313 --> 02:21:18,430
"Julie, darling, dear.
Free me from my fear.

1985
02:21:18,553 --> 02:21:22,114
You're all that I desire.
Wind, and rain...

1986
02:21:22,233 --> 02:21:23,712
...and fire."

1987
02:21:24,872 --> 02:21:29,127
And I have to bang her every half hour.
Why do I work out?

1988
02:21:29,233 --> 02:21:30,461
21 years old.

1989
02:21:30,633 --> 02:21:35,138
I can't sleep. Listen,
I've had wet dreams 3 nights in a row.

1990
02:21:35,233 --> 02:21:37,815
Like I was 15.
When did you last have one?

1991
02:21:38,553 --> 02:21:40,805
Television... Understand?

1992
02:21:40,993 --> 02:21:43,905
I'm sick of this meeting.
Let's do something.

1993
02:21:44,073 --> 02:21:46,075
- Calm down.
- Don't touch me.

1994
02:21:46,233 --> 02:21:48,155
- Let's make a decision.
- Drink.

1995
02:21:48,313 --> 02:21:50,315
Drink it yourself.
Don't touch me!

1996
02:21:50,473 --> 02:21:52,316
Let's do something.

1997
02:21:55,393 --> 02:21:57,315
What's so funny, eh?

1998
02:22:00,473 --> 02:22:01,986
See that pipe?

1999
02:22:02,233 --> 02:22:04,485
- What's that...
- No, do you see it?

2000
02:22:04,712 --> 02:22:06,475
- How many years?
- 40.

2001
02:22:06,633 --> 02:22:08,555
- How many more to come?
- 40.

2002
02:22:08,792 --> 02:22:09,770
Another 40.

2003
02:22:09,993 --> 02:22:11,551
And? What? What?

2004
02:22:12,233 --> 02:22:15,259
Everything's like that. Everything.

2005
02:22:15,633 --> 02:22:18,750
We come. We see. We judge.

2006
02:22:18,872 --> 02:22:22,273
We drink. We talk in circles.
That's all we do...

2007
02:22:22,393 --> 02:22:24,566
And everything's like that.

2008
02:22:43,073 --> 02:22:44,552
In other words,

2009
02:22:44,712 --> 02:22:47,419
I have a suggestion.
Let's be honest adults.

2010
02:22:47,792 --> 02:22:51,842
If even now,
after all my arguments,

2011
02:22:52,553 --> 02:22:55,420
you still vote to find
the kid not guilty

2012
02:22:55,553 --> 02:22:58,340
I'll join you. Sound good?

2013
02:22:59,473 --> 02:23:02,089
Wait a second. Wait. Wait.

2014
02:23:04,233 --> 02:23:09,068
And you'll definitely vote not guilty

2015
02:23:09,153 --> 02:23:10,871
if we all do?

2016
02:23:12,712 --> 02:23:14,475
I gave my word.

2017
02:23:14,633 --> 02:23:17,830
Well, you know, the word of an artist...

2018
02:23:19,313 --> 02:23:20,871
Fine.

2019
02:23:21,073 --> 02:23:25,214
Don't like the word of an artist,
I give you my word as an officer.

2020
02:23:27,233 --> 02:23:28,871
Ex-officer, right?

2021
02:23:33,993 --> 02:23:36,814
No such thing as a Russian ex-offi...

2022
02:24:01,073 --> 02:24:03,655
Let's vote. Who votes to find...

2023
02:24:05,153 --> 02:24:07,565
...the kid not guilty, raise your hand.

2024
02:24:12,633 --> 02:24:15,249
- We're voting for not guilty.
- Yes.

2025
02:24:21,153 --> 02:24:24,270
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9...

2026
02:24:24,473 --> 02:24:26,930
...10, 11...

2027
02:24:32,792 --> 02:24:34,384
...12.

2028
02:24:54,792 --> 02:24:55,975
"Not Guilty".

2029
02:25:14,553 --> 02:25:16,236
It's still a better place.

2030
02:25:17,792 --> 02:25:20,329
No, it hasn't worked out yet.
We'll talk.

2031
02:25:25,153 --> 02:25:26,996
Don't leave without me.

2032
02:25:43,633 --> 02:25:45,931
Would you recognize them?

2033
02:25:46,393 --> 02:25:48,725
Of course. I'll never forget them.

2034
02:26:04,792 --> 02:26:06,384
We'll find them.

2035
02:26:06,633 --> 02:26:09,579
We'll find them. I promise.

2036
02:26:11,872 --> 02:26:13,146
What was your father's name?

2037
02:26:13,313 --> 02:26:14,462
Ruslan.

2038
02:26:18,153 --> 02:26:20,815
- And your other one?
- Uncle Volodya.

2039
02:26:25,073 --> 02:26:26,301
My name's Nikolai.

2040
02:26:27,993 --> 02:26:30,245
Call me Uncle Nikolai.

2041
02:26:31,073 --> 02:26:32,711
If you want.

2042
02:26:36,233 --> 02:26:40,863
Let's get out of here. Let's go.
You can live with me.

2043
02:28:48,553 --> 02:28:50,316
So it's like this.

2044
02:28:51,712 --> 02:28:54,499
If you want to fly away, then fly.

2045
02:28:55,553 --> 02:28:59,364
The coast is clear.
If you want to stay, then stay.

2046
02:28:59,553 --> 02:29:01,145
But make the decision

2047
02:29:02,153 --> 02:29:03,916
all by yourself.

2048
02:29:05,553 --> 02:29:07,805
Nobody will do it for you.

2049
02:29:11,633 --> 02:29:13,396
It's been an honor.

2050
02:30:23,233 --> 02:30:26,100
"THE LAW IS ALL POWERFUL
AND CONSTANT

2051
02:30:26,233 --> 02:30:30,613
BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WHEN MERCY
HAS A GREATER FORCE THAN LAW"

2052
02:30:30,712 --> 02:30:32,555
